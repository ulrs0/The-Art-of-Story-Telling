2,Buckwheat,"""If you should chance, after a tempest, to cross a field where buckwheat is growing, you may observe that it looks black and singed, as if a flame of fire had passed over it. And should you ask the reason, a farmer will tell you, \""The lightning did that.\"" But how is it that the lightning did it?\n\nI will tell you what the sparrow told me, and the sparrow heard it from an aged willow which stood\u2014and still stands for that matter\u2014close to the field of buckwheat. This willow is tall and venerable, though old and crippled. Its trunk is split clear through the middle, and grass and blackberry tendrils creep out through the cleft. The tree bends forward, and its branches droop like long, green hair.\n\nIn the fields around the willow grew rye, wheat, and oats\u2014beautiful oats that, when ripe, looked like little yellow canary birds sitting on a branch. The harvest had been blessed, and the fuller the ears of grain, the lower they bowed their heads in reverent humility. There was also a field of buckwheat lying just in front of the old willow. The buckwheat did not bow its head, like the rest of the grain, but stood erect in stiff-necked pride.\n\n\""I am quite as rich as the oats,\"" it said; \""and, moreover, I am much more sightly. My flowers are as pretty as apple blossoms. It is a treat to look at me and my companions. Old willow, do you know anything more beautiful than we?\"" The willow nodded his head, as much as to say, \""Indeed I do!\"" But the buckwheat was so puffed with pride that it only said: \""The stupid tree! He is so old that grass is growing out of his body.\""\n\nNow there came on a dreadful storm, and the flowers of the field folded their leaves or bent their heads as it passed over them. The buckwheat flower alone stood erect in all its pride. \""Bow your heads, as we do,\"" called the flowers. \""There is no need for me to do that,\"" answered the buckwheat.\n\n\""Bow your head as we do,\"" said the grain. \""The angel of storms comes flying hither. He has wings that reach from the clouds to the earth; he will smite you before you have time to beg for mercy.\"" \""But I do not choose to bow down,\"" said the buckwheat.\n\n\""Close your flowers and fold your leaves,\"" said the old willow. \""Do not look at the lightning when the cloud breaks. Even human beings dare not do that, for in the midst of the lightning one may look straight into God's heaven. The sight strikes human beings blind, so dazzling is it. What would not happen to us, mere plants of the field, who are so much humbler, if we should dare do so?\"" \""So much humbler! Indeed! If there is a chance, I shall look right into God's heaven.\"" And in its pride and haughtiness, it did so. The flashes of lightning were so awful that it seemed as if the whole world were in flames.\n\nWhen the tempest was over, both the grain and the flowers, greatly refreshed by the rain, again stood erect in the pure, quiet air. But the buckwheat had been burned as black as a cinder by the lightning and stood in the field like a dead, useless weed. The old willow waved his branches to and fro in the wind, and large drops of water fell from his green leaves, as if he were shedding tears. \n\nThe sparrows asked: \""Why are you weeping when all around seems blest? Do you not smell the sweet perfume of flowers and bushes? The sun shines, and the clouds have passed from the sky. Why do you weep, old tree?\"" Then the willow told them of the buckwheat's stubborn pride and of the punishment which followed. I, who tell this tale, heard it from the sparrows. They told it to me one evening when I had asked them for a story."""
3,Flax,"""The flax was in full bloom, adorned with pretty little blue flowers as delicate as the wings of a moth. The sun shone brightly upon it, and the gentle showers nourished it. This nurturing was as beneficial for the flax as it is for little children to be washed and kissed by their mothers. The flax felt prettier for it, and it exclaimed, \""People say that I look exceedingly well, and that I am so fine and long that I shall make a beautiful piece of linen. How fortunate I am! It makes me so happy to know that something can be made of me. How the sunshine cheers me, and how sweet and refreshing is the rain! My happiness overpowers me! No one in the world can feel happier than I.\""\n\nHowever, the fern, with its knotty sticks, replied, \""Ah, yes, no doubt, but you do not know the world yet as well as I do.\"" It then sang mournfully, \""Snip, snap, snurre, Basse lurre. The song is ended.\"" The flax, undeterred, responded, \""No, it is not ended. Tomorrow the sun will shine or the rain will descend. I feel that I am growing. I feel that I am in full blossom. I am the happiest of all creatures, for I may someday come to something.\""\n\nOne day, people came and pulled the flax up by its roots, causing it great pain. It was then laid in water, as if to be drowned, and later placed near a fire, as if to be roasted. This was shocking for the flax, which reflected, \""We cannot expect to be happy always. By experiencing evil as well as good, we become wise.\"" Indeed, there was plenty of evil in store for the flax. It was steeped, roasted, broken, and combed, scarcely knowing what was happening to it. Eventually, it found itself on the spinning wheel, where it thought, \""Well, I have been very happy, and must be contented with the past.\"" And so it remained content until it was woven into a beautiful piece of white linen, with every last stalk of flax contributing to this creation.\n\n\""This is quite wonderful,\"" the flax exclaimed. \""I could not have believed that I should be so favored by fortune. The fern was not wrong when it sang, 'Snip, snap, snurre, Basse lurre.' But the song is not ended yet, I am sure. How wonderful it is that, after all I have suffered, I am made something of at last! I am the luckiest person in the world\u2014so strong and fine. And how white and long I am! This is far better than being a mere plant and bearing flowers. Now I am watched and cared for. Every morning the maid turns me over, and I have a shower bath from the watering pot every evening. Yes, and the clergyman's wife noticed me and said I was the best piece of linen in the whole parish. I cannot be happier than I am now.\""\n\nAs time passed, the linen was cut into pieces and pricked with needles, which was certainly not pleasant. However, it was transformed into twelve garments that everyone wore. \""See now, then,\"" said the flax, \""I have become something of importance. This was my destiny. It is quite a blessing. Now I shall be of some use in the world, as everyone ought to be. I am now divided into twelve pieces, and yet the whole dozen is all one and the same. It is most extraordinary good fortune.\""\n\nYears went by, and eventually, the linen became so worn that it could scarcely hold together. \""It must end very soon,\"" the pieces said to each other. \""We would gladly have held together a little longer, but it is useless to expect impossibilities.\"" Eventually, they fell into rags and tatters, thinking it was all over for them. They were torn to shreds, steeped in water, made into pulp, and dried, until they suddenly found themselves transformed into beautiful white paper. \""Well, now, this is a surprise\u2014a glorious surprise too,\"" said the paper. \""Now I am finer than ever, and who can tell what fine things I may have written upon me? This is wonderful luck!\"" \n\nIndeed, it was wonderful, for the most beautiful stories and poetry were written upon the paper, with only one blot, which was remarkable good fortune. The stories and poetry were read by people, making them wiser and better, as all that was written contained good and sensible meaning, along with a great blessing. \""I never imagined anything like this when I was only a little blue flower growing in the fields,\"" said the paper. \""How could I know that I should ever be the means of bringing knowledge and joy to men? I cannot understand it myself, and yet it is really so. Heaven knows that I have done nothing myself but what I was obliged to do with my weak powers for my own preservation; and yet I have been promoted from one joy and honor to another. Each time I think that the song is ended, something higher and better begins for me. I suppose now I shall be sent out to journey about the world, so that people may read me. It cannot be otherwise, for I have more splendid thoughts written upon me than I had pretty flowers in olden times. I am happier than ever.\""\n\nHowever, the paper did not go on its travels. Instead, it was sent to the printer, and all the words written upon it were set up in type to make a book\u2014or rather many hundreds of books\u2014so that many more people could derive pleasure and profit from a printed book than from the written paper. If the paper had been sent about the world, it would have been worn out before it had half finished its journey. \""Yes, this is certainly the wisest plan,\"" said the written paper. \""I really did not think of this. I shall remain at home and be held in honor like some old grandfather, as I really am to all these new books. They will do some good. I could not have wandered about as they can, yet he who wrote all this has looked at me as every word flowed from his pen upon my surface. I am the most honored of all.\""\n\nThen the paper was tied in a bundle with other papers and thrown into a tub that stood in the washhouse. \""After work, it is well to rest,\"" said the paper, \""and a very good opportunity to collect one's thoughts. Now I am able, for the first time, to learn what is in me; and to know one's self is true progress. What will be done with me now, I wonder? No doubt I shall still go forward. I have always progressed hitherto, I know quite well.\""\n\nOne day, all the paper in the tub was taken out and laid on the hearth to be burned. People said it could not be sold at the shop to wrap up butter and sugar because it had been written upon. The children in the house stood around the hearth to watch the blaze, for paper always flamed up prettily, and afterwards, among the ashes, there were many red sparks running here and there, as quick as the wind. They called it seeing the children come out of school, and the last spark, they said, was the schoolmaster. They often thought the last spark had come, and one would cry, \""There goes the schoolmaster,\"" but the next moment another spark would appear, bright and beautiful. They wondered where all the sparks went to, hoping to find out someday.\n\nThe whole bundle of paper was soon burning. \""Ugh!\"" cried the paper as it burst into a bright flame; \""ugh!\"" It was certainly not pleasant to be burned. But as the flames wrapped around it, the sparks mounted up into the air, higher than the flax had ever been able to raise its little blue flowers, glistening in a way the white linen never could. All the written letters turned red in an instant, and all the words and thoughts transformed into fire.\n\n\""Now I am mounting straight up to the sun,\"" said a voice in the flames, echoed by a thousand voices as the flames darted up through the chimney and out at the top. Tiny beings, as many as the flowers on the flax had been, floated above the children, invisible to mortal eyes. They were even lighter and more delicate than the blue flowers from which they were born. As the flames died out and nothing remained of the paper but black ashes, these little beings danced upon it, creating bright red sparks wherever they touched.\n\n\""The children are all out of school, and the schoolmaster was the last of all,\"" said the children. It was good fun, and they sang over the dead ashes, \""Snip, snap, snurre, Basse lurre. The song is ended.\"" But the little invisible beings whispered, \""The song is never ended; the most beautiful is yet to come.\"" However, the children could neither hear nor understand this, nor should they, for children must not know everything."""
5,Money Box,"""In a nursery where a number of toys lay scattered about, a money-box stood on the top of a very high wardrobe. It was made of clay in the shape of a pig and had been bought from the potter. In the back of the pig was a slit, which had been enlarged with a knife so that dollars or crown pieces might slip through. Indeed, there were two coins in the box, besides a number of pence. The money-pig was stuffed so full that it could no longer rattle, which is the highest state of perfection to which a money-pig can attain. There he stood upon the cupboard, high and lofty, looking down upon everything else in the room.\n\nHe knew very well that he had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave him a very good opinion of his own value. The rest thought of this fact also, although they did not express it, for there were so many other things to talk about. A large doll, still handsome though rather old, for her neck had been mended, lay inside one of the drawers which was partly open. She called out to the others, \""Let us have a game at being men and women; that is something worth playing at.\""\n\nUpon this, there was a great uproar. Even the engravings, which hung in frames on the wall, turned round in their excitement. They showed that they had a wrong side to them, although they had not the least intention to expose themselves in this way or to object to the game. It was late at night, but as the moon shone through the windows, they had light at a cheap rate. And as the game was now to begin, all were invited to take part in it, even the children's wagon, which certainly belonged to the coarser playthings. \""Each has its own value,\"" said the wagon; \""we cannot all be noblemen. There must be some to do the work.\""\n\nThe money-pig was the only one who received a written invitation. He stood so high that they were afraid he would not accept a verbal message. But in his reply, he said if he had to take a part, he must enjoy the sport from his own home. They were to arrange for him to do so; and so they did. The little toy theatre was therefore put up in such a way that the money-pig could look directly into it. Some wanted to begin with a comedy and afterwards have a tea party and a discussion for mental improvement, but they commenced with the latter first. The rocking-horse spoke of training and races, while the wagon discussed railways and steam power, for these subjects belonged to each of their professions, and it was right they should talk of them. The clock talked politics\u2014\""tick, tick;\"" he professed to know what the time of day was, but there was a whisper that he did not go correctly.\n\nThe bamboo cane stood by, looking stiff and proud. He was vain of his brass ferrule and silver top, and on the sofa lay two worked cushions, pretty but stupid. When the play at the little theatre began, the rest sat and looked on; they were requested to applaud and stamp or crack when they felt gratified with what they saw. But the riding-whip said he never cracked for old people, only for the young who were not yet married. \""I crack for everybody,\"" said the cracker. \""Yes, and a fine noise you make,\"" thought the audience, as the play went on.\n\nIt was not worth much, but it was very well played, and all the characters turned their painted sides to the audience, for they were made only to be seen on one side. The acting was wonderful, except that sometimes they came out beyond the lamps because the wires were a little too long. The doll, whose neck had been darned, was so excited that the place in her neck burst, and the money-pig declared he must do something for one of the players, as they had all pleased him so much. So he made up his mind to remember one of them in his will, as the one to be buried with him in the family vault whenever that event should happen. They all enjoyed the comedy so much that they gave up all thoughts of the tea party and only carried out their idea of intellectual amusement, which they called playing at men and women; and there was nothing wrong about it, for it was only play.\n\nAll the while, each one thought most of himself or of what the money-pig could be thinking. His thoughts were on, as he supposed, a very distant time\u2014of making his will, and of his burial, and of when it might all come to pass. Certainly sooner than he expected\u2014for all at once down he came from the top of the press, fell on the ground, and was broken to pieces. Then the pennies hopped and danced about in the most amusing manner. The little ones twirled round like tops, and the large ones rolled away as far as they could, especially the one great silver crown piece who had often to go out into the world, and now he had his wish as well as all the rest of the money. The pieces of the money-pig were thrown into the dust-bin, and the next day there stood a new money-pig on the cupboard, but it had not a farthing in its inside yet, and therefore, like the old one, it could not rattle. This was the beginning with him, and we will make it the end of our story."""
11,The Teapot,"""There was once a proud teapot; it was proud of being porcelain, proud of its long spout, and proud of its broad handle. It had something before and behind\u2014the spout before and the handle behind\u2014and that was what it talked about. However, it did not speak of its lid, which was cracked and riveted; these were defects, and one does not talk of one's defects, for there are plenty of others to do that. The cups, the cream pot, and the sugar bowl, the whole tea service, would think much more often of the lid's imperfections\u2014and talk about them\u2014than of the sound handle and the remarkable spout. The teapot knew it.\n\n\""I know you,\"" it said within itself. \""I know, too, my imperfection, and I am well aware that in that very thing is seen my humility, my modesty. Imperfections we all have, but we also have compensations. The cups have a handle, the sugar bowl a lid; I have both, and one thing besides, in front, which they can never have. I have a spout, and that makes me the queen of the tea table. I spread abroad a blessing on thirsting mankind, for in me the Chinese leaves are brewed in the boiling, tasteless water.\""\n\nAll this said the teapot in its fresh young life. It stood on the table that was spread for tea; it was lifted by a very delicate hand, but the delicate hand was awkward. The teapot fell, the spout snapped off, and the handle snapped off. The lid was no worse to speak of; the worst had been spoken of that. The teapot lay in a swoon on the floor while the boiling water ran out of it. It was a horrid shame, but the worst was that everybody jeered at it; they jeered at the teapot and not at the awkward hand.\n\n\""I never shall forget that experience,\"" said the teapot when it afterward talked of its life. \""I was called an invalid and placed in a corner, and the next day was given to a woman who begged for victuals. I fell into poverty and stood dumb both outside and in. But then, just as I was, began my better life. One can be one thing and still become quite another.\n\n\""Earth was placed in me. For a teapot, this is the same as being buried, but in the earth was placed a flower bulb. Who placed it there, who gave it, I know not; but given it was, and it became a compensation for the Chinese leaves and the boiling water, a compensation for the broken handle and spout. And the bulb lay in the earth, the bulb lay in me; it became my heart, my living heart, such as I had never before possessed. There was life in me, power and might. The heart pulsed, and the bulb put forth sprouts; it was the springing up of thoughts and feelings which burst forth into flower.\n\n\""I saw it, I bore it, I forgot myself in its delight. Blessed is it to forget oneself in another. The flower gave me no thanks; it did not think of me. It was admired and praised, and I was glad at that. How happy it must have been! One day I heard someone say that the flower deserved a better pot. I was thumped hard on my back, which was a great affliction, and the flower was put into a better pot. I was thrown out into the yard, where I lie as an old potsherd. But I have the memory, and that I can never lose.\"""""
13,What One Can Invent,"""There was once a young man who was studying to be a poet. He wanted to become one by Easter, to marry, and to live by poetry. He believed that writing poems only required the ability to invent something. However, he found himself unable to invent anything. He felt he had been born too late\u2014everything had been taken up before he came into the world, and everything had been written and told about. \n\n\""Happy people who were born a thousand years ago!\"" he lamented. \""It was an easy matter for them to become immortal. Even those born a hundred years ago were fortunate, for there was still something about which a poem could be written. Now the world is written out, and what can I write poetry about?\"" His despair deepened as he studied relentlessly, becoming ill and wretched. No doctor could help him, but perhaps the wise woman could. She lived in a little house by the wayside, where she opened the gate for those who rode and drove. Yet, she was more than just a gatekeeper; she was wiser than the doctor who drove in his own carriage and paid tax for his rank.\n\n\""I must go to her,\"" said the young man. The house in which she dwelt was small and neat, but dreary to behold, lacking flowers and trees. By the door stood a bee-hive, useful in its own right, along with a little potato-field and an earth bank with sloe bushes that had finished blossoming. The young man observed, \""That's a true picture of our poetryless time that I see before me now.\"" At least he had found a thought, a grain of gold, by the door of the wise woman.\n\n\""Write that down!\"" she urged. \""Even crumbs are bread. I know why you come hither. You cannot invent anything, and yet you want to be a poet by Easter.\"" The young man replied, \""Everything has been written down. Our time is not the old time.\"" \n\n\""No,\"" said the woman. \""In the old time, wise women were burnt, and poets went about with empty stomachs and very much out at elbows. The present time is good; it is the best of times. But you have not the right way of looking at it. Your ear is not sharpened to hear, and I fancy you do not say the Lord's Prayer in the evening. There is plenty here to write poems about, for anyone who knows the way. You can read it in the fruits of the earth, and you can draw it from the flowing and the standing water. You must understand how to catch a sunbeam. Now just try my spectacles on, and put my ear-trumpet to your ear, and then pray to God, and leave off thinking of yourself.\""\n\nThe last request was a difficult one\u2014more than a wise woman ought to ask. Nevertheless, he received the spectacles and the ear-trumpet and was placed in the middle of the potato-field. She handed him a great potato, and sounds began to emanate from within it. A song with words emerged, telling the history of the potato, an everyday story in ten parts, and it was indeed an interesting tale. \n\nThe potato sang of herself and her family, recounting her arrival in Europe and the misrepresentation she faced before being acknowledged as a greater treasure than a lump of gold. \""We were distributed by the King's command from the council-houses through various towns, and proclamation was made of our great value. But no one believed in it or understood how to plant us. One man dug a hole in the earth and threw in his whole bushel of potatoes. Another put one potato here and another there in the ground, expecting each to grow into a perfect tree from which he might shake down potatoes. They certainly grew, producing flowers and green watery fruit, but it all withered away. Nobody thought of what was in the ground\u2014the blessing\u2014the potato. Yes, we have endured and suffered; that is to say, our forefathers have; they and we, it is all one.\""\n\n\""What a story it was!\"" the young man exclaimed. \""Well, and that will do,\"" said the woman. \""Now look at the sloe bush.\"" The sloe bushes chimed in, \""We have also some near relations in the home of the potatoes, but higher towards the north than they grew. There were Northmen from Norway who steered westward through mist and storm to an unknown land, where, behind ice and snow, they found plants and green meadows, and bushes with blue-black grapes\u2014sloe bushes. The grapes were ripened by the frost just as we are. They called the land 'wine-land,' that is, 'Groenland,' or 'Sloeland.'\""\n\n\""That is quite a romantic story,\"" said the young man. \""Yes, certainly. But now come with me,\"" said the wise woman, leading him to the bee-hive. He looked inside and marveled at the life and labor within. Bees stood in all the passages, waving their wings to create a wholesome draught of air through the great manufactory. The queen-bee wanted to fly out, but the others bit off her wings, forcing her to stay. \n\n\""Now get upon the earth bank,\"" said the wise woman. \""Come and look out over the highway, where you can see the people.\"" The young man gazed at the crowd, exclaiming, \""What a crowd it is! One story after another. It whirls and whirls! It's quite a confusion before my eyes. I shall go out at the back.\"" \n\n\""No, go straight forward,\"" said the woman. \""Go straight into the crowd of people. Look at them in the right way. Have an ear to hear and the right heart to feel, and you will soon invent something. But before you go away, you must give me my spectacles and my ear-trumpet again.\"" \n\nAs she took both from him, he remarked, \""Now I do not see the smallest thing, and now I don't hear anything more.\"" \n\n\""Why, then, you can't be a poet by Easter,\"" said the wise woman. \n\n\""But, by what time can I be one?\"" he asked. \n\n\""Neither by Easter nor by Whitsuntide! You will not learn how to invent anything.\"" \n\n\""What must I do to earn my bread by poetry?\"" he inquired. \n\n\""You can do that before Shrove Tuesday. Hunt the poets! Kill their writings and thus you will kill them. Don't be put out of countenance. Strike at them boldly, and you'll have carnival cake, on which you can support yourself and your wife too.\"" \n\n\""What one can invent!\"" cried the young man. And so he hit out boldly at every second poet, for he could not be a poet himself. We have it from the wise woman. She knows WHAT ONE CAN INVENT."""
15,The Of Miss Moppet,"""This is a pussy called Miss Moppet; she thinks she has heard a mouse! \n\nThis is the mouse peeping out from behind the cupboard, making fun of Miss Moppet. He is not afraid of a kitten. \n\nThis is Miss Moppet jumping just too late; she misses the mouse and hits her own head. She thinks it is a very hard cupboard! \n\nThe mouse watches Miss Moppet from the top of the cupboard. \n\nMiss Moppet ties up her head in a duster and sits before the fire. The mouse thinks she is looking very ill, so he comes sliding down the bell-pull. \n\nMiss Moppet looks worse and worse, and the mouse comes a little nearer. She holds her poor head in her paws and looks at him through a hole in the duster. The mouse comes very close. \n\nAnd then all of a sudden, Miss Moppet jumps upon the mouse! Because the mouse has teased Miss Moppet, she thinks she will tease the mouse, which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet. \n\nShe ties him up in the duster and tosses it about like a ball. But she forgot about that hole in the duster; when she unties it, there is no mouse! \n\nHe has wriggled out and run away, and he is dancing a jig on the top of the cupboard!"""
16,The Pie And The Patty Pan,"""Once upon a time, there was a Pussy-cat called Ribby, who invited a little dog named Duchess to tea. Ribby wrote a letter to Duchess, saying, \""Come in good time, my dear Duchess, and we will have something so very nice. I am baking it in a pie-dish\u2014a pie-dish with a pink rim. You never tasted anything so good! And YOU shall eat it all! I will eat muffins, my dear Duchess!\"" Duchess read the letter and replied, \""I will come with much pleasure at a quarter past four. But it is very strange. I was just going to invite you to come here, to supper, my dear Ribby, to eat something MOST DELICIOUS.\"" She then added, \""I hope it isn't mouse?\"" but scratched it out to say, \""I hope it will be fine,\"" before giving her letter to the postman.\n\nDuchess thought a great deal about Ribby's pie and read the letter over and over again. \""I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be mouse!\"" she said to herself. \""I really couldn't, COULDN'T eat mouse pie. And I shall have to eat it because it is a party. And MY pie was going to be veal and ham.\"" Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf to look at it. \""It is all ready to put into the oven. Such lovely pie-crust; and I put in a little tin patty-pan to hold up the crust; and I made a hole in the middle with a fork to let out the steam\u2014Oh, I do wish I could eat my own pie instead of a pie made of mouse!\"" \n\nAfter considering her options, Duchess had a clever idea. \""Why shouldn't I rush along and put my pie into Ribby's oven when Ribby isn't there?\"" she thought, feeling delighted with her own cleverness. Meanwhile, Ribby had received Duchess's answer and, as soon as she was sure that the little dog would come, she popped HER pie into the oven. Ribby put the pie into the lower oven, thinking, \""The top oven bakes too quickly.\"" She prepared a pie of the most delicate and tender mouse minced up with bacon, having taken out all the bones because Duchess had nearly choked on a fish-bone last time. Ribby then set about cleaning and preparing her home for the party.\n\nRibby went out to fetch milk and butter, and at the same time, Duchess came out of her house, carrying a basket covered with a cloth. They only bowed to one another as they passed, not speaking because they were both excited about the party. As soon as Duchess was out of sight, she ran straight to Ribby's house. Ribby went to the shop to buy what she needed and had a pleasant chat with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit, who was disdainful about the idea of a little dog and a pie for afternoon tea.\n\nWhen Ribby returned home, she noticed a scuffling noise in the back passage but found no one there. She opened the bottom oven door with some difficulty and was greeted by the pleasing smell of baked mouse. Meanwhile, Duchess had slipped out the back door after putting her pie into Ribby's oven. \""It is very odd that Ribby's pie was NOT in the oven when I put mine in!\"" she thought, feeling anxious. Duchess went home, brushed her coat, and picked flowers for Ribby while waiting for the clock to strike four.\n\nRibby, after ensuring no one was hiding in her house, changed into a lovely lilac silk gown for the party. She set the table with her best china tea-set and prepared the tea. When Duchess arrived punctually at four o'clock, she brought flowers and commented on the delicious smell of pie. Ribby confirmed it was mouse and bacon, and they began to enjoy their tea together. Duchess, however, was feeling uneasy about the pie she had eaten.\n\nAs they ate, Duchess became increasingly anxious about the patty-pan she thought she had swallowed. She fumbled with the spoon, trying to find it, but Ribby assured her there was no patty-pan in the pie. Duchess, feeling ill, began to moan and whine, claiming she had swallowed a large tin patty-pan. Ribby, concerned, decided to fetch Dr. Maggotty, the village doctor.\n\nWhile Ribby was gone, Duchess sat before the fire, feeling miserable. She got up to check the pie-dish again and discovered a rich, steamy flavor coming from the top oven. To her surprise, there stood a fine brown pie, and through a hole in the crust, she saw her little tin patty-pan. Realizing she had been eating mouse pie, Duchess felt relieved but also embarrassed about having to explain it to Ribby.\n\nWhen Ribby returned with Dr. Maggotty, Duchess pretended to be asleep. The doctor, however, was not fooled and insisted she take a bread pill. Duchess, feeling much better, decided it was time to go home. Ribby lent her a shawl, and they said their goodbyes affectionately. After Duchess left, Ribby found a smashed pink and white pie-dish in the yard, along with the patty-pan left by Dr. Maggotty.\n\nRibby stared in amazement, realizing there had indeed been a patty-pan. \""Did you ever see the like! So there really WAS a patty-pan? But my patty-pans are all in the kitchen cupboard. Well, I never did! Next time I want to give a party, I will invite Cousin Tabitha Twitchit!\"""""
17,The Roly Poly Pudding,"""Once upon a time, there was an old cat named Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who was an anxious parent. She had a habit of losing her kittens continually, and whenever they went missing, they were always up to mischief! On baking day, she decided to shut them up in a cupboard to keep them safe. She managed to catch Moppet and Mittens, but Tom was nowhere to be found.\n\nMrs. Tabitha searched high and low throughout the house, mewing for Tom Kitten. She looked in the pantry under the staircase and searched the best spare bedroom, which was covered in dust sheets. She even ventured upstairs to the attics, but Tom was nowhere to be found. The old house was full of cupboards and passages, with thick walls that seemed to hide secrets. Odd noises echoed within, and things often disappeared at night, especially cheese and bacon.\n\nAs Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted, Moppet and Mittens found their way into mischief. The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out, heading straight for the dough that was set to rise in a pan before the fire. They began to pat it with their little soft paws, contemplating making muffins, when suddenly someone knocked at the front door. Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in fright, while Mittens ran away to hide in an empty jar in the dairy.\n\nThe visitor was Mrs. Ribby, a neighbor who had come to borrow some yeast. Mrs. Tabitha, still mewing dreadfully, invited her in and shared her troubles. \""I've lost my dear son Thomas; I'm afraid the rats have got him,\"" she lamented, wiping her eyes with an apron. Mrs. Ribby, not afraid of rats, offered to help find Tom and scold him for his misbehavior. However, Mrs. Tabitha soon realized that Moppet and Mittens were also missing.\n\nTogether, Ribby and Tabitha searched the house thoroughly again, poking under beds and rummaging through cupboards. They even fetched a candle to look inside a clothes chest in one of the attics. Although they could not find Tom, they heard a door bang and someone scuttered downstairs. Mrs. Tabitha tearfully recounted her troubles with the rats, mentioning how she had caught seven young ones the previous week. The two cats continued their search, hearing a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor, but still found nothing.\n\nReturning to the kitchen, Ribby managed to drag Moppet out of the flour barrel. Moppet, in a state of fright, exclaimed that an old woman rat had stolen some of the dough. They rushed to check the dough pan and found marks of little scratching fingers, confirming Moppet's story. Ribby and Tabitha took Moppet with them to keep her safe while they continued their search, eventually finding Mittens hiding in an empty jar in the dairy. Mittens reported that a dreadful enormous rat had stolen a pat of butter and the rolling-pin.\n\nRealizing the seriousness of the situation, Ribby suggested they send for John Joiner with a saw. Meanwhile, Tom Kitten was having his own adventure. Not wanting to be shut up in a cupboard, he had decided to hide in the chimney. The fire had just been lit, and Tom climbed up into the fireplace, eventually getting lost in the chimney's flues. He found himself in a dark, confusing place, where he stumbled upon a hole in the wall leading to a small, stuffy room.\n\nIn this room, he encountered an enormous rat named Samuel Whiskers, who was not pleased with Tom's unexpected arrival. Before Tom knew it, he was tied up by Anna Maria, Samuel's wife, who planned to make him into a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for dinner. The rats discussed their culinary plans, and while Tom struggled to free himself, they went off to gather ingredients from the kitchen.\n\nTom Kitten, unable to call for help due to being tied up and covered in soot, wriggled about in despair. Meanwhile, the rats returned and began to prepare him for cooking. Just as they were about to roll him in dough, they heard the sounds of a saw and a little dog barking. Realizing they were discovered, the rats quickly abandoned their plans and fled, leaving Tom behind.\n\nWhen John Joiner arrived, he found only the rolling-pin and a very dirty Tom Kitten. The cat family had recovered from their ordeal and invited him to stay for dinner. They managed to peel the dumpling off Tom and made it separately, while Tom was given a hot bath to remove the butter. Although John Joiner had to leave for another job, he noted the strong smell of rats lingering in the air.\n\nLater, as the sun began to set, the townsfolk noticed Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife making their escape with bundles on a little wheelbarrow. They were headed to Farmer Potatoes' barn, where they would cause more trouble. The cat family, now free from their rat troubles, found that Moppet and Mittens had grown into excellent rat-catchers, earning a living by hunting down the pesky creatures. However, Tom Kitten remained fearful of rats, never daring to face anything larger than a mouse."""
18,The Tale Of Bad Mice,"""Once upon a time, there was a very beautiful doll's house; it was red brick with white windows, and it had real muslin curtains, a front door, and a chimney. It belonged to two dolls called Lucinda and Jane; at least it belonged to Lucinda, but she never ordered meals. Jane was the Cook, but she never did any cooking because the dinner had been bought ready-made, in a box full of shavings. There were two red lobsters, a ham, a fish, a pudding, and some pears and oranges. They would not come off the plates, but they were extremely beautiful.\n\nOne morning, Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll's perambulator. There was no one in the nursery, and it was very quiet. Presently, there was a little scuffling, scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace, where there was a hole under the skirting-board. Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment and then popped it in again. Tom Thumb was a mouse. A minute afterwards, Hunca Munca, his wife, put her head out too; and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal-box.\n\nThe doll's house stood at the other side of the fireplace. Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearth-rug. They pushed the front door\u2014it was not fast. Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went upstairs and peeped into the dining-room. Then they squeaked with joy! Such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table! There were tin spoons, lead knives and forks, and two dolly-chairs\u2014all so convenient!\n\nTom Thumb set to work at once to carve the ham. It was a beautiful shiny yellow, streaked with red. The knife crumpled up and hurt him; he put his finger in his mouth. \""It is not boiled enough; it is hard. You have a try, Hunca Munca.\"" Hunca Munca stood up in her chair and chopped at the ham with another lead knife. \""It's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger's,\"" said Hunca Munca. The ham broke off the plate with a jerk and rolled under the table. \""Let it alone,\"" said Tom Thumb; \""give me some fish, Hunca Munca!\""\n\nHunca Munca tried every tin spoon in turn; the fish was glued to the dish. Then Tom Thumb lost his temper. He put the ham in the middle of the floor and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel\u2014bang, bang, smash, smash! The ham flew all into pieces, for underneath the shiny paint, it was made of nothing but plaster! Then there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca. They broke up the pudding, the lobsters, the pears, and the oranges. As the fish would not come off the plate, they put it into the red-hot crinkly paper fire in the kitchen; but it would not burn either.\n\nTom Thumb went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the top\u2014there was no soot. While Tom Thumb was up the chimney, Hunca Munca had another disappointment. She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser, labeled \""Rice,\"" \""Coffee,\"" and \""Sago\""; but when she turned them upside down, there was nothing inside except red and blue beads. Then those mice set to work to do all the mischief they could\u2014especially Tom Thumb! He took Jane's clothes out of the chest of drawers in her bedroom and threw them out of the top-floor window.\n\nBut Hunca Munca had a frugal mind. After pulling half the feathers out of Lucinda's bolster, she remembered that she herself was in want of a feather-bed. With Tom Thumb's assistance, she carried the bolster downstairs and across the hearth-rug. It was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mouse-hole, but they managed it somehow. Then Hunca Munca went back and fetched a chair, a bookcase, a bird-cage, and several small odds and ends. The bookcase and the bird-cage refused to go into the mouse-hole.\n\nHunca Munca left them behind the coal-box and went to fetch a cradle. Hunca Munca was just returning with another chair when suddenly there was a noise of talking outside upon the landing. The mice rushed back to their hole, and the dolls came into the nursery. What a sight met the eyes of Jane and Lucinda! Lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared, and Jane leaned against the kitchen dresser and smiled; but neither of them made any remark.\n\nThe bookcase and the bird-cage were rescued from under the coal-box, but Hunca Munca had got the cradle and some of Lucinda's clothes. She also had some useful pots and pans, and several other things. The little girl that the doll's house belonged to said, \""I will get a doll dressed like a policeman!\"" But the nurse said, \""I will set a mouse-trap!\"" \n\nSo that is the story of the two Bad Mice. But they were not so very, very naughty after all, because Tom Thumb paid for everything he broke. He found a crooked sixpence under the hearth-rug; and upon Christmas Eve, he and Hunca Munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of Lucinda and Jane. And very early every morning\u2014before anybody is awake\u2014Hunca Munca comes with her dustpan and her broom to sweep the Dollies' house!"""
19,The Tale Of Benjamin Bunny,"""One morning, a little rabbit sat on a bank, pricking his ears to listen to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony. A gig was coming along the road, driven by Mr. McGregor, with Mrs. McGregor sitting beside him in her best bonnet. As soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road and set off\u2014with a hop, skip, and a jump\u2014to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.\n\nThat wood was full of rabbit holes, and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived his cousins\u2014Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter. Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffetees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar). She also sold herbs, rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender). Little Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt, so he came round the back of the fir-tree and nearly tumbled upon the top of his cousin Peter.\n\nPeter was sitting by himself, looking poorly and dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief. \""Peter,\"" said little Benjamin in a whisper, \""who has got your clothes?\"" Peter replied, \""The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden,\"" and described how he had been chased about the garden, dropping his shoes and coat. Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that Mr. McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also, certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet. Peter said he hoped that it would rain.\n\nAt this point, old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole calling, \""Cotton-tail! Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!\"" Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk. They went away hand in hand and climbed onto the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood. From there, they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden, where Peter's coat and shoes were plainly visible upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.\n\nLittle Benjamin said, \""It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear tree.\"" Peter fell down head first, but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft. It had been sown with lettuces, and they left a great many odd little foot-marks all over the bed, especially little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs. Little Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back Peter's clothes so they could use the pocket handkerchief.\n\nThey took the clothes off the scarecrow. There had been rain during the night, so there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk. Benjamin tried on the tam-o-shanter, but it was too big for him. Then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions as a little present for his Aunt. Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises. Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home and ate a lettuce leaf, saying that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner. The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.\n\nThe lettuces certainly were very fine, but Peter did not eat anything; he said he would like to go home. Presently, he dropped half the onions. Little Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear tree with a load of vegetables. He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden, walking along a little path on planks under a sunny red-brick wall. The mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones and winked at Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.\n\nPresently, Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again. They got amongst flower-pots, frames, and tubs; Peter heard noises worse than ever, and his eyes were as big as lolly-pops! He was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped. This is what those little rabbits saw round that corner! Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself, Peter, and the onions underneath a large basket.\n\nThe cat got up, stretched herself, and came to sniff at the basket. Perhaps she liked the smell of onions! Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket. She sat there for five hours. I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket because it was quite dark, and the smell of onions was fearful; it made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry. The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon, but still, the cat sat upon the basket.\n\nAt length, there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above. The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace. He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco and had a little switch in his hand. He was looking for his son. Old Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats. He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall onto the top of the cat, cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the garden-house, scratching off a handful of fur. The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.\n\nWhen old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door. Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears and whipped him with the little switch. After that, he took out his nephew Peter and then the handkerchief of onions, marching out of the garden. When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later, he observed several things that perplexed him. It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs\u2014only the foot-marks were too ridiculously little! Also, he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up inside the greenhouse, locking the door on the outside.\n\nWhen Peter got home, his mother forgave him because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat. Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the rabbit-tobacco."""
20,The Tale Of Jemina Puddle Duck,"""What a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen! Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs. Her sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebeccah Puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to someone else. \""I have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, Jemima. You would let them go cold; you know you would!\"" \n\n\""I wish to hatch my own eggs; I will hatch them all by myself,\"" quacked Jemima Puddle-duck. She tried to hide her eggs, but they were always found and carried off. Jemima Puddle-duck became quite desperate. She determined to make a nest right away from the farm. \n\nShe set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart-road that leads over the hill. She was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet. When she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance. She thought that it looked a safe quiet spot. Jemima Puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying. She ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air. She flew beautifully when she had got a good start. She skimmed along over the tree-tops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared. \n\nJemima alighted rather heavily and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting-place. She rather fancied a tree-stump amongst some tall fox-gloves. But seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper. He had black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers. \n\n\""Quack?\"" said Jemima Puddle-duck, with her head and her bonnet on one side\u2014\""Quack?\"" The gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at Jemima. \""Madam, have you lost your way?\"" said he. He had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp. Jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome. She explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting-place. \n\n\""Ah! is that so? indeed!\"" said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking curiously at Jemima. He folded up the newspaper and put it in his coat-tail pocket. Jemima complained of the superfluous hen. \""Indeed! how interesting! I wish I could meet with that fowl. I would teach it to mind its own business!\"" \n\n\""But as to a nest\u2014there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers in my wood-shed. No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. You may sit there as long as you like,\"" said the bushy long-tailed gentleman. He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the fox-gloves. It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney. \n\n\""This is my summer residence; you would not find my earth\u2014my winter house\u2014so convenient,\"" said the hospitable gentleman. There was a tumble-down shed at the back of the house, made of old soap-boxes. The gentleman opened the door and showed Jemima in. The shed was almost quite full of feathers\u2014it was almost suffocating; but it was comfortable and very soft. Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers. But it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any trouble at all. \n\nWhen she came out, the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper\u2014at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it. He was so polite that he seemed almost sorry to let Jemima go home for the night. He promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again next day. He said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his wood-shed. \n\nJemima Puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest. They were greeny white and very large. The foxy gentleman admired them immensely. He used to turn them over and count them when Jemima was not there. At last, Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day\u2014\""and I will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched. They might catch cold,\"" said the conscientious Jemima. \n\n\""Madam, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; I will provide oats. But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you a treat. Let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves!\"" \""May I ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm-garden to make a savoury omelette? Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley. I will provide lard for the stuff-lard for the omelette,\"" said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers. \n\nJemima Puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious. She went round the farm-garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck. And she waddled into the kitchen and got two onions out of a basket. The collie-dog Kep met her coming out, \""What are you doing with those onions? Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima Puddle-duck?\"" \n\nJemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story. The collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers. He asked several questions about the wood, and about the exact position of the house and shed. Then he went out and trotted down the village. He went to look for two fox-hound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher. \n\nJemima Puddle-duck went up the cart-road for the last time, on a sunny afternoon. She was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag. She flew over the wood and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman. He was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air and kept glancing uneasily round the wood. When Jemima alighted, he quite jumped. \n\n\""Come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs. Give me the herbs for the omelette. Be sharp!\"" He was rather abrupt. Jemima Puddle-duck had never heard him speak like that. She felt surprised and uncomfortable. While she was inside, she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed. Someone with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and then locked it. Jemima became much alarmed. \n\nA moment afterwards, there were most awful noises\u2014barking, baying, growls and howls, squealing and groans. And nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman. Presently, Kep opened the door of the shed and let out Jemima Puddle-duck. Unfortunately, the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them. He had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping. \n\nJemima Puddle-duck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs. She laid some more in June, and she was permitted to keep them herself; but only four of them hatched. Jemima Puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had always been a bad sitter."""
21,The Tale Of Mr Jeremy Fisher,"""Mr. Jeremy put on a macintosh and a pair of shiny goloshes. He took his rod and basket and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat. The boat was round and green, very much like the other lily leaves, and it was tied to a water plant in the middle of the pond.\n\nMr. Jeremy took a reed pole and pushed the boat out into open water. \""I know a good place for minnows,\"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. He stuck his pole into the mud and fastened his boat to it. Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle. He had the dearest little red float, a tough stalk of grass for a rod, a fine long white horse-hair line, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end.\n\nAs the rain trickled down his back, Mr. Jeremy stared at the float for nearly an hour. \""This is getting tiresome; I think I should like some lunch,\"" he said. He punted back again amongst the water plants and took some lunch out of his basket. \""I will eat a butterfly sandwich and wait till the shower is over,\"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.\n\nSuddenly, a great big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his goloshes. Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and continued eating his sandwich. Once or twice, something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond. \""I trust that is not a rat,\"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; \""I think I had better get away from here.\""\n\nMr. Jeremy shoved the boat out again a little way and dropped in the bait. Almost immediately, there was a bite; the float gave a tremendous bobbit! \""A minnow! A minnow! I have him by the nose!\"" cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher, jerking up his rod. But what a horrible surprise! Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy landed little Jack Sharp the stickleback, covered with spines!\n\nThe stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until he was quite out of breath. Then he jumped back into the water, and a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out and laughed at Mr. Jeremy Fisher. While Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat, sucking his sore fingers and peering down into the water, a much worse thing happened\u2014a really frightful thing it would have been if Mr. Jeremy had not been wearing a macintosh!\n\nA great big enormous trout came up\u2014ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash\u2014and it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap. \""Ow! Ow! Ow!\"" he cried, and then it turned and dove down to the bottom of the pond! However, the trout was so displeased with the taste of the macintosh that in less than half a minute, it spat him out again; the only thing it swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's goloshes.\n\nMr. Jeremy bounced up to the surface of the water like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle. He swam with all his might to the edge of the pond and scrambled out on the first bank he came to. Hopping home across the meadow with his macintosh all in tatters, he exclaimed, \""What a mercy that was not a pike! I have lost my rod and basket, but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should never have dared to go fishing again!\""\n\nOnce home, he put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to dinner. Although he could not offer them fish, he had something else in his larder. Sir Isaac Newton wore his black and gold waistcoat, and Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag. Instead of a nice dish of minnows, they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce, which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but I think it must have been nasty!"""
22,The Tale Of Mrs. Tiggy Winkle,"""Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town. She was a good little girl, but she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs! One day, little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying\u2014oh, she did cry so! \""I've lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have YOU seen them, Tabby Kitten?\"" \n\nThe kitten went on washing her white paws, so Lucie asked a speckled hen, \""Sally Henny-penny, has YOU found three pocket-handkins?\"" But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking, \""I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!\"" Then Lucie asked Cock Robin, who was sitting on a twig. Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye and flew over a stile and away. \n\nLucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little-town\u2014a hill that goes up, up, into the clouds as though it had no top! A great way up the hillside, she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass. Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep pathway\u2014up and up\u2014until Little-town was right away down below; she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney! \n\nPresently, she came to a spring bubbling out from the hillside. Someone had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water, but the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! Where the sand upon the path was wet, there were foot-marks of a VERY small person. Lucie ran on and on. The path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins\u2014but no pocket-handkerchiefs! \n\nBut there was something else\u2014a door straight into the hill; and inside it, someone was singing: \""Lily-white and clean, oh! With little frills between, oh! Smooth and hot\u2014red rusty spot Never here be seen, oh!\"" Lucie knocked\u2014once, twice\u2014and interrupted the song. A little frightened voice called out, \""Who's that?\"" Lucie opened the door, and what do you think there was inside the hill? A nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams\u2014just like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it, and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there. \n\nThere was a nice hot singey smell, and at the table, with an iron in her hand, stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie. Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap\u2014where Lucie had yellow curls\u2014that little person had PRICKLES! \n\n\""WHO are you?\"" said Lucie. \""Have you seen my pocket-handkins?\"" The little person made a bob-curtsey. \""Oh, yes, if you please'm; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear-starcher!\"" And she took something out of a clothes-basket and spread it on the ironing-blanket. \n\n\""WHAT'S that thing?\"" said Lucie. \""That's not my pocket-handkin?\"" \""Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!\"" And she ironed it and folded it, putting it on one side. Then she took something else off a clothes-horse. \""That isn't my pinny?\"" said Lucie. \""Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! It's very bad to wash!\"" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. \n\nMrs. Tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire. \""THERE'S one of my pocket-handkins!\"" cried Lucie. \""And there's my pinny!\"" Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, goffered it, and shook out the frills. \""Oh that IS lovely!\"" said Lucie. \n\n\""AND what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?\"" \""Oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny\u2014look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! She'll very soon go barefoot!\"" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. \""WHY, there's another handkersniff\u2014but it isn't mine; it's red?\"" \""Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it DID so smell of onions! I've had to wash it separately; I can't get out the smell.\"" \n\n\""There's another one of mine,\"" said Lucie. \""WHAT are those funny little white things?\"" \""That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron them; she washes them herself.\"" \""There's my last pocket-handkin!\"" said Lucie. \""AND what are you dipping into the basin of starch?\"" \""They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse\u2014most terrible particular!\"" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. \""Now I've finished my ironing; I'm going to air some clothes.\"" \n\n\""WHAT are these dear soft fluffy things?\"" said Lucie. \""Oh, those are wooly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl.\"" \""Will their jackets take off?\"" asked Lucie. \""Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. And here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town. They're ALWAYS marked at washing!\"" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. \n\nAnd she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes\u2014small brown coats of mice; one velvety black mole-skin waist-coat; a red tail-coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing\u2014and at last the basket was empty! \n\nThen Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea\u2014a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie. They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were HAIR-PINS sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her. \n\nWhen they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, fastened with a silver safety-pin. Then they made up the fire with turf, came out, locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill. \n\nThen away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes! All the way down the path, little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny! And she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. \n\nSo that at the bottom of the hill, when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle. Lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say \""Good-night,\"" and to thank the washer-woman\u2014but what a VERY odd thing! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill! \n\nShe was running, running, running up the hill\u2014and where was her white frilled cap? And her shawl? And her gown\u2014and her petticoat? And how small she had grown\u2014and how brown\u2014and covered with PRICKLES! Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG. \n\n(Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile\u2014but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin? And besides\u2014I have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells\u2014and besides I am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!)"""
23,The Tale Of Peter Rabbit,"""Once upon a time, there were four little rabbits, and their names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter. They lived with their mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir tree. \n\n\""Now, my dears,\"" said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, \""you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor. Now run along, and don't get into mischief. I am going out.\"" \n\nThen old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella to the baker's. She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns. Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries; but Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden and squeezed under the gate! \n\nFirst, he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes; and then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley. But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor! Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, \""Stop thief!\"" \n\nPeter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate. He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes. After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new. \n\nPeter gave himself up for lost and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement and implored him to exert himself. Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him. He rushed into the toolshed and jumped into a can. It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in if it had not had so much water in it. \n\nMr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each. Presently, Peter sneezed\u2014\""Kertyschoo!\"" Mr. McGregor was after him in no time, and tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work. \n\nPeter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also, he was very damp from sitting in that can. After a time, he began to wander about, going lippity\u2014lippity\u2014not very fast, and looking all around. He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath. \n\nAn old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry. Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some goldfish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny. \n\nHe went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe\u2014scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch. Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently, as nothing happened, he came out and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over. The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate! \n\nPeter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes. Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care. He slipped underneath the gate and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden. \n\nMr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scarecrow to frighten the blackbirds. Peter never stopped running or looked behind him until he got home to the big fir tree. He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole and shut his eyes. His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight! \n\nI am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening. His mother put him to bed and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter! \""One tablespoonful to be taken at bedtime.\"" But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper."""
24,The Tale Of The Flopsy Bunnies,"""It is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is \""soporific.\"" I have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then I am not a rabbit. They certainly had a very soporific effect upon the Flopsy Bunnies!\n\nWhen Benjamin Bunny grew up, he married his Cousin Flopsy. They had a large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful. I do not remember the separate names of their children; they were generally called the \""Flopsy Bunnies.\"" As there was not always quite enough to eat, Benjamin used to borrow cabbages from Flopsy's brother, Peter Rabbit, who kept a nursery garden. Sometimes Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.\n\nWhen this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden. Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap was a mixture. There were jam pots and paper bags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which always tasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two. One day\u2014oh joy!\u2014there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces, which had \""shot\"" into flower.\n\nThe Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces. By degrees, one after another, they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown grass. Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children. Before going to sleep, he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies.\n\nThe little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun. From the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine. The blue-bottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots. (I can tell you her name; she was called Thomasina Tittlemouse, a woodmouse with a long tail.)\n\nShe rustled across the paper bag and awakened Benjamin Bunny. The mouse apologized profusely and said that she knew Peter Rabbit. While she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a heavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy Bunnies! Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag. The mouse hid in a jam pot.\n\nThe little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific. They dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed. Mr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack. He saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings. He stared at them for some time.\n\nPresently, a fly settled on one of them, and it moved. Mr. McGregor climbed down onto the rubbish heap\u2014\""One, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits!\"" said he as he dropped them into his sack. The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was turning them over in bed. They stirred a little in their sleep, but still they did not wake up.\n\nMr. McGregor tied up the sack and left it on the wall. He went to put away the mowing machine. While he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy Bunny (who had remained at home) came across the field. She looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was. Then the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag off his head, and they told the doleful tale.\n\nBenjamin and Flopsy were in despair; they could not undo the string. But Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person. She nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack. The little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them. Their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows, an old blacking-brush, and two decayed turnips.\n\nThen they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor. Mr. McGregor came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off. He carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy. The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance. They watched him go into his house. And then they crept up to the window to listen.\n\nMr. McGregor threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies if they had happened to have been inside it. They could hear him drag his chair on the flags and chuckle\u2014\""One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!\"" said Mr. McGregor. \""Eh? What's that? What have they been spoiling now?\"" enquired Mrs. McGregor.\n\n\""One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!\"" repeated Mr. McGregor, counting on his fingers\u2014\""one, two, three\u2014\"" \""Don't you be silly; what do you mean, you silly old man?\"" \""In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six!\"" replied Mr. McGregor. (The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the window-sill.)\n\nMrs. McGregor took hold of the sack and felt it. She said she could feel six, but they must be OLD rabbits because they were so hard and all different shapes. \""Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.\"" \""Line your old cloak?\"" shouted Mr. McGregor\u2014\""I shall sell them and buy myself baccy!\"" \""Rabbit tobacco! I shall skin them and cut off their heads.\""\n\nMrs. McGregor untied the sack and put her hand inside. When she felt the vegetables, she became very, very angry. She said that Mr. McGregor had \""done it a purpose.\"" And Mr. McGregor was very angry too. One of the rotten marrows came flying through the kitchen window and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny. It was rather hurt.\n\nThen Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home. So Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her rabbit skins. But next Christmas, Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough rabbit-wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and a pair of warm mittens."""
25,The Tale Of Timmy Tiptoes,"""Once upon a time, there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel called Timmy Tiptoes. He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree, and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody. Timmy Tiptoes sat out, enjoying the breeze; he whisked his tail and chuckled, \""Little wife Goody, the nuts are ripe; we must lay up a store for winter and spring.\"" Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the thatch, saying, \""The nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter.\"" Timmy replied, \""Then we shall wake up all the thinner when there is nothing to eat in spring-time,\"" showing his prudent nature.\n\nWhen Timmy and Goody Tiptoes came to the nut thicket, they found other squirrels were there already. Timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig; they worked away quietly by themselves. Every day, they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts, carrying them away in bags and storing them in several hollow stumps near the tree where they had built their nest. When these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole high up a tree that had belonged to a woodpecker. The nuts rattled down\u2014down\u2014down inside. Goody questioned, \""How shall you ever get them out again? It is like a money-box!\"" Timmy replied, \""I shall be much thinner before spring-time, my love,\"" peeping into the hole.\n\nThey did collect quantities because they did not lose them. Squirrels who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half because they cannot remember the place. The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail. He began to dig but could not remember where he had buried his nuts. In his frustration, he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him, leading to a fight. Soon, other squirrels began to dig, and the whole wood was in commotion!\n\nUnfortunately, just at this time, a flock of little birds flew by, searching for green caterpillars and spiders. There were several sorts of little birds, twittering different songs. The first one sang, \""Who's been digging up MY nuts? Who's been digging up MY nuts?\"" Another sang, \""Little bit of bread and NO cheese! Little bit of bread and NO cheese!\"" The squirrels followed and listened. The first little bird flew into the bush where Timmy and Goody Tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags and sang, \""Who's been digging up MY nuts?\"" Timmy Tiptoes continued his work without replying, as the little bird did not expect an answer; it was only singing its natural song.\n\nHowever, when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy Tiptoes, cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts. The innocent little bird that had caused all the mischief flew away in fright! Timmy rolled over and over, then turned tail and fled towards his nest, followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting, \""Who's been digging up MY nuts?\"" They caught him and dragged him up the very same tree where there was the little round hole, pushing him in. The hole was much too small for Timmy Tiptoes' figure, and they squeezed him dreadfully; it was a wonder they did not break his ribs. \""We will leave him here till he confesses,\"" said Silvertail Squirrel, shouting into the hole, \""Who's been digging up MY nuts?\""\n\nTimmy Tiptoes made no reply; he had tumbled down inside the tree upon half a peck of nuts belonging to himself. He lay quite stunned and still. Goody Tiptoes picked up the nut bags and went home, making a cup of tea for Timmy, but he didn't come and didn't come. Goody Tiptoes passed a lonely and unhappy night. The next morning, she ventured back to the nut bushes to look for him, but the other unkind squirrels drove her away. She wandered all over the wood, calling, \""Timmy Tiptoes! Timmy Tiptoes! Oh, where is Timmy Tiptoes?\""\n\nIn the meantime, Timmy Tiptoes came to his senses. He found himself tucked up in a little moss bed, very much in the dark, feeling sore; it seemed to be underground. Timmy coughed and groaned because his ribs hurt him. There was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk appeared with a night light, hoping he felt better. It was most kind to Timmy Tiptoes; it lent him its nightcap, and the house was full of provisions. The Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the tree, saying, \""Besides, I found a few buried!\"" It laughed and chuckled when it heard Timmy's story. While Timmy was confined to bed, it enticed him to eat quantities, saying, \""But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I thin myself? My wife will be anxious!\"" \""Just another nut\u2014or two nuts; let me crack them for you,\"" said the Chipmunk. Timmy Tiptoes grew fatter and fatter!\n\nNow Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself. She did not put any more nuts into the woodpecker's hole because she had always doubted how they could be got out again. She hid them under a tree root, and they rattled down, down, down. Once, when Goody emptied an extra big bagful, there was a decided squeak, and next time, when Goody brought another bagful, a little striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry. \""It is getting perfectly full-up downstairs; the sitting room is full, and they are rolling along the passage; and my husband, Chippy Hackee, has run away and left me. What is the explanation of these showers of nuts?\""\n\n\""I am sure I beg your pardon; I did not know that anybody lived here,\"" said Mrs. Goody Tiptoes. \""But where is Chippy Hackee? My husband, Timmy Tiptoes, has run away too.\"" \""I know where Chippy is; a little bird told me,\"" said Mrs. Chippy Hackee. She led the way to the woodpecker's tree, and they listened at the hole. Down below, there was a noise of nut crackers, and a fat squirrel voice and a thin squirrel voice were singing together, \""My little old man and I fell out, How shall we bring this matter about? Bring it about as well as you can, And get you gone, you little old man!\""\n\n\""You could squeeze in through that little round hole,\"" said Goody Tiptoes. \""Yes, I could,\"" said the Chipmunk, \""but my husband, Chippy Hackee, bites!\"" Down below, there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling, and then the fat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang, \""For the diddlum day, Day diddle dum di! Day diddle diddle dum day!\"" Then Goody peeped in at the hole and called down, \""Timmy Tiptoes! Oh fie, Timmy Tiptoes!\"" Timmy replied, \""Is that you, Goody Tiptoes? Why, certainly!\"" He came up and kissed Goody through the hole, but he was so fat that he could not get out. Chippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come; he stayed down below and chuckled.\n\nAnd so it went on for a fortnight until a big wind blew off the top of the tree, opening up the hole and letting in the rain. Then Timmy Tiptoes came out and went home with an umbrella. But Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week, although it was uncomfortable. At last, a large bear came walking through the wood, perhaps also looking for nuts; he seemed to be sniffing around. Chippy Hackee went home in a hurry!\n\nWhen Chippy Hackee got home, he found he had caught a cold in his head, and he was more uncomfortable still. Now Timmy and Goody Tiptoes keep their nut store fastened up with a little padlock. Whenever that little bird sees the Chipmunks, he sings, \""Who's been digging up MY nuts? Who's been digging up MY nuts?\"" But nobody ever answers!"""
26,The Toad,"""The well was deep, and therefore the rope had to be a long one. It was heavy work turning the handle when anyone had to raise a bucketful of water over the edge of the well. Though the water was clear, the sun never looked down far enough into the well to mirror itself in the waters. But as far as its beams could reach, green things grew forth between the stones in the sides of the well.\n\nDown below dwelt a family of the Toad race. They had, in fact, come head-over-heels down the well, in the person of the old Mother-Toad, who was still alive. The green Frogs, who had been established there a long time and swam about in the water, called them \""well-guests.\"" But the newcomers seemed determined to stay where they were, for they found it very agreeable living \""in a dry place,\"" as they called the wet stones.\n\nThe Mother-Frog had once been a traveler. She happened to be in the water-bucket when it was drawn up, but the light became too strong for her, and she got a pain in her eyes. Fortunately, she scrambled out of the bucket. But she fell into the water with a terrible flop and had to lie sick for three days with pains in her back. She certainly had not much to tell of the things up above, but she knew this, and all the Frogs knew it, that the well was not all the world. The Mother-Toad might have told this and that if she had chosen, but she never answered when they asked her anything, and so they left off asking.\n\n\""She's thick, and fat and ugly,\"" said the young green Frogs. \""And her children will be just as ugly as she is.\"" \n\n\""That may be,\"" retorted the mother-Toad, \""but one of them has a jewel in his head, or else I have the jewel.\"" \n\nThe young frogs listened and stared. As these words did not please them, they made grimaces and dived down under the water. But the little Toads kicked up their hind legs from mere pride, for each of them thought that he must have the jewel. Then they sat and held their heads quite still. But at length they asked what it was that made them so proud, and what kind of a thing a jewel might be.\n\n\""Oh, it is such a splendid and precious thing, that I cannot describe it,\"" said the Mother-Toad. \""It's something which one carries about for one's own pleasure, and that makes other people angry. But don't ask me any questions, for I shan't answer you.\"" \n\n\""Well, I haven't got the jewel,\"" said the smallest of the Toads; she was as ugly as a toad can be. \""Why should I have such a precious thing? And if it makes others angry, it can't give me any pleasure. No, I only wish I could get to the edge of the well and look out. It must be beautiful up there.\""\n\n\""You'd better stay where you are,\"" said the old Mother-Toad, \""for you know everything here, and you can tell what you have. Take care of the bucket, for it will crush you to death. Even if you get into it safely, you may fall out. And it's not every one who falls so cleverly as I did, and gets away with whole legs and whole bones.\""\n\n\""Quack!\"" said the little Toad. That's just as if one of us were to say, \""Aha!\"" \n\nShe had an immense desire to get to the edge of the well and to look over. She felt such a longing for the green, up there. The next morning, when it chanced that the bucket was being drawn up, filled with water, and stopped for a moment just in front of the stone on which the Toad sat, the little creature's heart moved within it. Our Toad jumped into the filled bucket, which presently was drawn to the top and emptied out.\n\n\""Ugh, you beast!\"" said the farm laborer who emptied the bucket when he saw the toad. \""You're the ugliest thing I've seen for one while.\"" And he made a kick with his wooden shoe at the toad, which just escaped being crushed by managing to scramble into the nettles that grew high by the well's brink. Here she saw stem by stem, but she looked up also. The sun shone through the leaves, which were quite transparent. She felt as a person would feel who steps suddenly into a great forest, where the sun looks in between the branches and leaves.\n\n\""It's much nicer here than down in the well! I should like to stay here my whole life long!\"" said the little Toad. So she lay there for an hour, yes, for two hours. \""I wonder what is to be found up here? As I have come so far, I must try to go still farther.\"" And so she crawled on as fast as she could crawl. She got out upon the highway, where the sun shone upon her, and the dust powdered her all over as she marched across the way.\n\n\""I've got to a dry place now, and no mistake,\"" said the Toad. \""It's almost too much of a good thing here; it tickles one so.\"" \n\nShe came to the ditch. Forget-me-nots were growing there, and meadow-sweet. A very little way off was a hedge of whitethorn, and elder bushes grew there, too, and bindweed with white flowers. Gay colors were to be seen here, and a butterfly, too, was flitting by. The Toad thought it was a flower that had broken loose that it might look about better in the world, which was quite a natural thing to do.\n\n\""If one could only make such a journey as that!\"" said the Toad. \""Croak! how capital that would be.\"" \n\nEight days and eight nights she stayed by the well and experienced no want of provisions. On the ninth day she thought, \""Forward! onward!\"" But what could she find more charming and beautiful? Perhaps a little toad or a few green frogs. During the last night, there had been a sound borne on the breeze, as if there were cousins in the neighborhood.\n\n\""It's a glorious thing to live! glorious to get out of the well, and to lie among the stinging-nettles, and to crawl along the dusty road. But onward, onward! that we may find frogs or a little toad. We can't do without that. Nature alone is not enough for one.\"" And so she went forward on her journey.\n\nShe came out into the open field, to a great pond, round about which grew reeds. She walked into it. \n\n\""It will be too damp for you here,\"" said the Frogs; \""but you are very welcome! Are you a he or a she? But it doesn't matter; you are equally welcome.\"" \n\nAnd she was invited to the concert in the evening\u2014the family concert. Great enthusiasm and thin voices; we know the sort of thing. No refreshments were given, only there was plenty to drink, for the whole pond was free.\n\n\""Now I shall resume my journey,\"" said the little Toad. She always felt a longing for something better. \n\nShe saw the stars shining, so large and so bright, and she saw the moon gleaming. Then she saw the sun rise and mount higher and higher.\n\n\""Perhaps after all, I am still in a well, only in a larger well. I must get higher yet; I feel a great restlessness and longing.\"" And when the moon became round and full, the poor creature thought, \""I wonder if that is the bucket which will be let down, and into which I must step to get higher up? Or is the sun the great bucket? How great it is! how bright it is! It can take up all. I must look out, that I may not miss the opportunity. Oh, how it seems to shine in my head! I don't think the jewel can shine brighter. But I haven't the jewel; not that I cry about that\u2014no, I must go higher up, into splendor and joy! I feel so confident, and yet I am afraid. It's a difficult step to take, and yet it must be taken. Onward, therefore, straight onward!\""\n\nShe took a few steps, such as a crawling animal may take, and soon found herself on a road beside which people dwelt. There were flower gardens as well as kitchen gardens. And she sat down to rest by a kitchen garden.\n\n\""What a number of different creatures there are that I never knew! and how beautiful and great the world is! But one must look round in it, and not stay in one spot.\"" And then she hopped into the kitchen garden. \""How green it is here! how beautiful it is here!\""\n\n\""I know that,\"" said the Caterpillar, on the leaf, \""my leaf is the largest here. It hides half the world from me, but I don't care for the world.\"" \n\n\""Cluck, cluck!\"" And some fowls came. They tripped about in the cabbage garden. The Fowl who marched at the head of them had a long sight. She spied the Caterpillar on the green leaf and pecked at it, so that the Caterpillar fell on the ground, where it twisted and writhed.\n\nThe Fowl looked at it first with one eye and then with the other, for she did not know what the end of this writhing would be. \n\n\""It doesn't do that with a good will,\"" thought the Fowl, and lifted up her head to peck at the Caterpillar.\n\nThe Toad was so horrified at this that she came crawling straight up towards the Fowl. \n\n\""Aha, it has allies,\"" quoth the Fowl. \""Just look at the crawling thing!\"" And then the Fowl turned away. \""I don't care for the little green morsel; it would only tickle my throat.\"" The other fowls took the same view of it, and they all turned away together.\n\n\""I writhed myself free,\"" said the Caterpillar. \""What a good thing it is when one has presence of mind! But the hardest thing remains to be done, and that is to get on my leaf again. Where is it?\"" \n\nAnd the little Toad came up and expressed her sympathy. She was glad that in her ugliness she had frightened the fowls.\n\n\""What do you mean by that?\"" cried the Caterpillar. \""I wriggled myself free from the Fowl. You are very disagreeable to look at. Cannot I be left in peace on my own property? Now I smell cabbage. Now I am near my leaf. Nothing is so beautiful as property. But I must go higher up.\""\n\n\""Yes, higher up,\"" said the little Toad; \""higher-up! She feels just as I do; but she's not in a good humor today. That's because of the fright. We all want to go higher up.\"" And she looked up as high as ever she could.\n\nThe stork sat in his nest on the roof of the farmhouse. He clapped with his beak, and the Mother-stork clapped with hers. \n\n\""How high up they live!\"" thought the Toad. \""If one could only get as high as that!\"" \n\nIn the farmhouse lived two young students; one was a poet and the other a scientific searcher into the secrets of nature. The one sang and wrote joyously of everything that God had created, and how it was mirrored in his heart. He sang it out clearly, sweetly, richly, in well-sounding verses; while the other investigated created matter itself, and even cut it open where need was. He looked upon God's creation as a great sum in arithmetic\u2014subtracted, multiplied, and tried to know it within and without, and to talk with understanding concerning it; and that was a very sensible thing; and he spoke joyously and cleverly of it. They were good, joyful men, those two.\n\n\""There sits a good specimen of a toad,\"" said the naturalist. \""I must have that fellow in a bottle of spirits.\"" \n\n\""You have two of them already,\"" replied the poet. \""Let the thing sit there and enjoy its life.\"" \n\n\""But it's so wonderfully ugly,\"" persisted the first. \n\n\""Yes, if we could find the jewel in its head,\"" said the poet, \""I too should be for cutting it open.\"" \n\n\""A jewel!\"" cried the naturalist. \""You seem to know a great deal about natural history.\"" \n\n\""But is there not something beautiful in the popular belief that just as the toad is the ugliest of animals, it should often carry the most precious jewel in its head? Is it not just the same thing with men? What a jewel that was that Aesop had, and still more, Socrates!\"" \n\nThe Toad did not hear any more, nor did she understand half of what she had heard. The two friends walked on, and thus she escaped the fate of being bottled up in spirits.\n\n\""Those two also were speaking of the jewel,\"" said the Toad to herself. \""What a good thing that I have not got it! I might have been in a very disagreeable position.\"" \n\nNow there was a clapping on the roof of the farmhouse. Father-Stork was making a speech to his family, and his family was glancing down at the two young men in the kitchen garden.\n\n\""Man is the most conceited creature!\"" said the Stork. \""Listen how their jaws are wagging; and for all that they can't clap properly. They boast of their gifts of eloquence and their language! Yes, a fine language truly! Why, it changes in every day's journey we make. One of them doesn't understand another. Now, we can speak our language over the whole earth\u2014up in the North and in Egypt. And then men are not able to fly, moreover. They rush along by means of an invention they call 'railway;' but they often break their necks over it. It makes my beak turn cold when I think of it. The world could get on without men. We could do without them very well, so long as we only keep frogs and earth-worms.\""\n\n\""That was a powerful speech,\"" thought the little Toad. \""What a great man that is yonder! and how high he sits! Higher than ever I saw anyone sit yet; and how he can swim!\"" she cried, as the Stork soared away through the air with outspread pinions.\n\nAnd the Mother-Stork began talking in the nest and told about Egypt and the waters of the Nile, and the incomparable mud that was to be found in that strange land; and all this sounded new and very charming to the little Toad.\n\n\""I must go to Egypt!\"" said she. \""If the Stork or one of his young ones would only take me! I would oblige him in return. Yes, I shall get to Egypt, for I feel so happy! All the longing and all the pleasure that I feel is much better than having a jewel in one's head.\""\n\nAnd it was just she who had the jewel. That jewel was the continual striving and desire to go upward\u2014ever upward. It gleamed in her head, gleamed in joy, beamed brightly in her longing.\n\nThen, suddenly, up came the Stork. He had seen the Toad in the grass and stooped down and seized the little creature anything but gently. The Stork's beak pinched her, and the wind whistled; it was not exactly agreeable, but she was going upward\u2014upward towards Egypt\u2014and she knew it; and that was why her eyes gleamed, and a spark seemed to fly out of them.\n\n\""Quunk!--ah!\"" \n\nThe body was dead\u2014the Toad was killed! But the spark that had shot forth from her eyes; what became of that?\n\nThe sunbeam took it up; the sunbeam carried the jewel from the head of the toad. Whither? \n\nAsk not the naturalist; rather ask the poet. He will tell it thee under the guise of a fairy tale; and the Caterpillar on the cabbage, and the Stork family belong to the story. Think! the Caterpillar is changed and turns into a beautiful butterfly; the Stork family flies over mountains and seas, to the distant Africa, and yet finds the shortest way home to the same country\u2014to the same roof. Nay, that is almost too improbable; and yet it is true. You may ask the naturalist; he will confess it is so; and you know it yourself, for you have seen it.\n\nBut the jewel in the head of the toad? \n\nSeek it in the sun; see it there if you can. \n\nThe brightness is too dazzling there. We have not yet such eyes as can see into the glories which God has created, but we shall receive them by-and-by; and that will be the most beautiful story of all, and we shall all have our share in it."""
27,The Top And Ball,"""A whipping top and a little ball lay together in a box, among other toys, and the top said to the ball, \""Shall we be married, as we live in the same box?\"" But the ball, which wore a dress of morocco leather and thought as much of herself as any other young lady, would not even condescend to reply.\n\nThe next day, the little boy to whom the playthings belonged painted the top red and yellow and drove a brass-headed nail into the middle, so that while the top was spinning round, it looked splendid. \""Look at me,\"" said the top to the ball. \""What do you say now? Shall we be engaged to each other? We should suit so well; you spring, and I dance. No one could be happier than we should be.\"" \n\n\""Indeed! do you think so? Perhaps you do not know that my father and mother were morocco slippers, and that I have a Spanish cork in my body,\"" replied the ball. \""Yes; but I am made of mahogany,\"" said the top. \""The major himself turned me. He has a turning lathe of his own, and it is a great amusement to him.\""\n\nThe next day, the ball was taken out by the boy. The top saw it flying high in the air, like a bird, until it would go quite out of sight. Each time it came back, as it touched the earth, it gave a higher leap than before, either because it longed to fly upwards or from having a Spanish cork in its body. But the ninth time it rose in the air, it remained away and did not return. The boy searched everywhere for it, but he searched in vain; it was gone. \n\n\""I know very well where she is,\"" sighed the top; \""she is in the swallow's nest and has married the swallow.\"" The more the top thought of this, the more he longed for the ball. His love increased the more, just because he could not get her; and that she should have been won by another was the worst of all. The top still twirled about and hummed, but he continued to think of the ball, and the more he thought of her, the more beautiful she seemed to his fancy.\n\nThus several years passed by, and his love became quite old. The top, also, was no longer young; but there came a day when he looked handsomer than ever, for he was gilded all over. He was now a golden top and whirled and danced about until he hummed quite loud and was something worth looking at. However, one day he leaped too high, and then he, also, was gone. They searched everywhere, even in the cellar, but he was nowhere to be found. Where could he be? He had jumped into the dust-bin, where all sorts of rubbish were lying: cabbage-stalks, dust, and rain-droppings that had fallen down from the gutter under the roof.\n\n\""Now I am in a nice place,\"" said he; \""my gilding will soon be washed off here. Oh dear, what a set of rabble I have got amongst!\"" And then he glanced at a curious round thing like an old apple, which lay near a long, leafless cabbage-stalk. It was, however, not an apple, but an old ball, which had lain for years in the gutter and was soaked through with water.\n\n\""Thank goodness, here comes one of my own class, with whom I can talk,\"" said the ball, examining the gilded top. \""I am made of morocco,\"" she said. \""I was sewn together by a young lady, and I have a Spanish cork in my body; but no one would think it, to look at me now. I was once engaged to a swallow; but I fell in here from the gutter under the roof, and I have lain here more than five years and have been thoroughly drenched. Believe me, it is a long time for a young maiden.\""\n\nThe top said nothing, but he thought of his old love; and the more she said, the clearer it became to him that this was the same ball. The servant then came to clean out the dust-bin. \""Ah,\"" she exclaimed, \""here is a gilt top.\"" So the top was brought again to notice and honor, but nothing more was heard of the little ball. He spoke not a word about his old love, for that soon died away. When the beloved object has lain for five years in a gutter and has been drenched through, no one cares to know her again on meeting her in a dust-bin."""
28,The Bunyip,"""Long, long ago, far, far away on the other side of the world, some young men left the camp where they lived to get some food for their wives and children. The sun was hot, but they liked the heat, and as they went, they ran races and tried to see who could hurl his spear the farthest or was cleverest in throwing a strange weapon called a boomerang, which always returns to the thrower. They did not get on very fast at this rate, but presently they reached a flat place that, in time of flood, was full of water. However, now, in the height of summer, it was only a set of pools, each surrounded by a fringe of plants, with bulrushes standing in the inside of all.\n\nIn that country, the people are fond of the roots of bulrushes, which they think are as good as onions. One of the young men suggested that they had better collect some of the roots and carry them back to the camp. It did not take them long to weave the tops of the willows into a basket, and they were just going to wade into the water and pull up the bulrush roots when a youth suddenly called out, \""After all, why should we waste our time doing work that is only fit for women and children? Let them come and get the roots for themselves; but we will fish for eels and anything else we can get.\""\n\nThis delighted the rest of the party, and they all began to arrange their fishing lines, made from the bark of the yellow mimosa, and to search for bait for their hooks. Most of them used worms, but one, who had put a piece of raw meat for dinner into his skin wallet, cut off a little bit and baited his line with it, unseen by his companions.\n\nFor a long time, they cast patiently without receiving a single bite. The sun had grown low in the sky, and it seemed as if they would have to go home empty-handed, not even with a basket of roots to show. Suddenly, the youth who had baited his hook with raw meat saw his line disappear under the water. Something, which he presumed was a very heavy fish, was pulling so hard that he could hardly keep his feet. For a few minutes, it seemed as if he must let go or be dragged into the pool. He cried to his friends for help, and at last, trembling with fright at what they were going to see, they managed to land on the bank a creature that was neither a calf nor a seal, but something of both, with a long, broad tail. They looked at each other with horror, cold shivers running down their spines; for though they had never beheld it, there was not a man amongst them who did not know what it was\u2014the cub of the awful Bunyip!\n\nAll of a sudden, the silence was broken by a low wail, answered by another from the other side of the pool, as the mother rose up from her den and came towards them, rage flashing from her horrible yellow eyes. \""Let it go! let it go!\"" whispered the young men to each other, but the captor declared that he had caught it and was going to keep it. \""He had promised his sweetheart,\"" he said, \""that he would bring back enough meat for her father's house to feast on for three days, and though they could not eat the little Bunyip, her brothers and sisters should have it to play with.\"" So, flinging his spear at the mother to keep her back, he threw the little Bunyip onto his shoulders and set out for the camp, never heeding the poor mother's cries of distress.\n\nBy this time, it was getting near sunset, and the plain was in shadow, though the tops of the mountains were still quite bright. The youths had all ceased to be afraid when they were startled by a low rushing sound behind them. Looking round, they saw that the pool was slowly rising, and the spot where they had landed the Bunyip was quite covered. \""What could it be?\"" they asked one another; there was not a cloud in the sky, yet the water had risen higher already than they had ever known it to do before.\n\nFor an instant, they stood watching as if they were frozen, then they turned and ran with all their might, the man with the Bunyip running faster than all. When he reached a high peak overlooking the plain, he stopped to take breath and turned to see if he was safe yet. Safe! Why, only the tops of the trees remained above that sea of water, and these were fast disappearing. They must run fast indeed if they were to escape. So on they flew, scarcely feeling the ground as they went, until they flung themselves on the ground before the holes scooped out of the earth where they had all been born. The old men were sitting in front, the children were playing, and the women were chattering together when the little Bunyip fell into their midst, and there was scarcely a child among them who did not know that something terrible was upon them.\n\n\""The water! the water!\"" gasped one of the young men, and there it was, slowly but steadily mounting the ridge itself. Parents and children clung together, as if by that means they could drive back the advancing flood; and the youth who had caused all this terrible catastrophe seized his sweetheart and cried, \""I will climb with you to the top of that tree, and there no waters can reach us.\""\n\nBut as he spoke, something cold touched him, and quickly he glanced down at his feet. Then, with a shudder, he saw that they were feet no longer, but bird's claws. He looked at the girl he was clasping and beheld a great black bird standing at his side. He turned to his friends, but a flock of great awkward flapping creatures stood in their place. He put up his hands to cover his face, but they were no more hands, only the ends of wings; and when he tried to speak, a noise such as he had never heard before seemed to come from his throat, which had suddenly become narrow and slender. Already the water had risen to his waist, and he found himself sitting easily upon it, while its surface reflected back the image of a black swan, one of many.\n\nNever again did the swans become men, but they are still different from other swans, for in the nighttime, those who listen can hear them talk in a language that is certainly not swan's language; and there are even sounds of laughing and talking, unlike any noise made by the swans whom we know.\n\nThe little Bunyip was carried home by its mother, and after that, the waters sank back to their own channels. The side of the pool where she lives is always shunned by everyone, as nobody knows when she may suddenly put out her head and draw him into her mighty jaws. But people say that underneath the black waters of the pool, she has a house filled with beautiful things, such as mortals who dwell on the earth have no idea of. Though how they know, I cannot tell you, as nobody has ever seen it."""
29,The Golden Blackbird,"""Once upon a time, there was a great lord who had three sons. He fell very ill and sent for doctors of every kind, even bonesetters, but none of them could find out what was the matter with him or even give him any relief. At last, a foreign doctor arrived and declared that only the Golden Blackbird could cure the sick man. The old lord then dispatched his eldest son to search for the wonderful bird, promising him great riches if he managed to find it and bring it back.\n\nThe young man began his journey and soon arrived at a place where four roads met. Unsure of which path to take, he tossed his cap in the air, deciding that the direction of its fall would guide him. After traveling for two or three days, he grew tired of walking without knowing where he was going, so he stopped at an inn filled with merrymakers and ordered something to eat and drink. \""My faith,\"" he said, \""it is sheer folly to waste more time hunting for this bird. My father is old, and if he dies, I shall inherit his goods.\""\n\nAfter waiting patiently for some time, the old man sent his second son to seek the Golden Blackbird. The youth took the same direction as his brother and, upon reaching the crossroads, tossed his cap to decide which road to take. The cap fell in the same place as before, and he walked on until he reached the inn where his brother had halted. The elder brother, leaning out of the window, called to him to stay and amuse himself. \""You are right,\"" replied the youth. \""Who knows if I should ever find the Golden Blackbird, even if I searched the whole world for it? At worst, if the old man dies, we shall have his property.\"" They entered the inn and feasted until their money was all spent, even owing something to their landlord, who kept them as hostages until they could pay their debts.\n\nThe youngest son set forth in his turn and soon arrived at the inn where his brothers were still prisoners. They called to him to stop and tried to prevent him from going further. \""No,\"" he replied, \""my father trusted me, and I will go all over the world until I find the Golden Blackbird.\"" \""Bah,\"" said his brothers, \""you will never succeed any better than we did. Let him die if he wants to; we will divide the property.\"" As he continued on his way, he met a little hare, who stopped to look at him and asked, \""Where are you going, my friend?\"" \n\n\""I really don't quite know,\"" he answered. \""My father is ill, and he cannot be cured unless I bring him back the Golden Blackbird. It has been a long time since I set out, but no one can tell me where to find it.\"" \""Ah,\"" said the hare, \""you have a long way to go yet. You will have to walk at least seven hundred miles before you get to it.\"" \""And how am I to travel such a distance?\"" \""Mount on my back,\"" said the little hare, \""and I will conduct you.\"" The young man obeyed, and with each bound, the little hare covered seven miles. It wasn't long before they reached a castle that was as large and beautiful as a castle could be.\n\n\""The Golden Blackbird is in a little cabin nearby,\"" said the little hare, \""and you will easily find it. It lives in a little cage, with another cage beside it made entirely of gold. But whatever you do, be sure not to put it in the beautiful cage, or everybody in the castle will know that you have stolen it.\"" The youth found the Golden Blackbird standing on a wooden perch, but it was as stiff and rigid as if it were dead. Beside the beautiful cage was the cage of gold. \""Perhaps he would revive if I were to put him in that lovely cage,\"" thought the youth.\n\nThe moment the Golden Bird touched the bars of the splendid cage, it awoke and began to whistle, causing all the servants of the castle to run to see what was the matter, claiming that he was a thief and must be put in prison. \""No,\"" he answered, \""I am not a thief. If I have taken the Golden Blackbird, it is only that it may cure my father, who is ill, and I have traveled more than seven hundred miles to find it.\"" \""Well,\"" they replied, \""we will let you go and will even give you the Golden Bird if you are able to bring us the Porcelain Maiden.\""\n\nThe youth departed, weeping, and met the little hare, who was munching wild thyme. \""What are you crying for, my friend?\"" asked the hare. \""It is because,\"" he answered, \""the castle people will not allow me to carry off the Golden Blackbird without giving them the Porcelain Maiden in exchange.\"" \""You have not followed my advice,\"" said the little hare. \""And you have put the Golden Bird into the fine cage.\"" \""Alas! yes!\"" \""Don't despair! The Porcelain Maiden is a young girl, beautiful as Venus, who dwells two hundred miles from here. Jump on my back, and I will take you there.\""\n\nThe little hare, who took seven miles in a stride, arrived in no time at all and stopped on the borders of a lake. \""The Porcelain Maiden,\"" said the hare to the youth, \""will come here to bathe with her friends while I eat a mouthful of thyme to refresh me. When she is in the lake, be sure to hide her clothes, which are of dazzling whiteness, and do not give them back to her unless she consents to follow you.\"" The little hare left him, and almost immediately, the Porcelain Maiden arrived with her friends. She undressed and got into the water. The young man glided up noiselessly and laid hold of her clothes, which he hid under a rock at some distance.\n\nWhen the Porcelain Maiden was tired of playing in the water, she came out to dress herself, but despite searching high and low, she could not find her clothes. Her friends helped her in the search, but seeing that it was of no use, they left her alone on the bank, weeping bitterly. \""Why do you cry?\"" said the young man, approaching her. \""Alas!\"" she answered, \""while I was bathing, someone stole my clothes, and my friends have abandoned me.\"" \""I will find your clothes if you will only come with me.\"" The Porcelain Maiden agreed to follow him, and after giving up her clothes, the young man bought a small horse for her, which went like the wind. The little hare brought them both back to seek the Golden Blackbird, and as they drew near to the castle where it lived, the little hero said to the young man, \""Now, do be a little sharper than you were before, and you will manage to carry off both the Golden Blackbird and the Porcelain Maiden. Take the golden cage in one hand, and leave the bird in the old cage where he is, and bring that away too.\""\n\nThe little hare then vanished, and the youth did as he was instructed. The castle servants never noticed that he was carrying off the Golden Bird. When he reached the inn where his brothers were detained, he delivered them by paying their debt. They set out together, but as the two elder brothers were jealous of the success of the youngest, they took the opportunity, while passing by the shores of a lake, to throw themselves upon him, seize the Golden Bird, and fling him into the water. They continued their journey, taking with them the Porcelain Maiden, believing their brother was drowned. Fortunately, he had managed to grab onto a tuft of rushes and called loudly for help. The little hare came running to him and said, \""Take hold of my leg and pull yourself out of the water.\""\n\nOnce he was safe on shore, the little hare instructed him, \""Now this is what you have to do: dress yourself like a Breton seeking a place as a stable-boy, and go and offer your services to your father. Once there, you will easily be able to make him understand the truth.\"" The young man followed the little hare's advice and went to his father's castle, inquiring if they were in need of a stable-boy. \""Yes,\"" replied his father, \""very much indeed. But it is not an easy place. There is a little horse in the stable that will not let anyone go near it, and it has already kicked to death several people who have tried to groom it.\"" \""I will undertake to groom it,\"" said the youth. \""I have never seen a horse I was afraid of yet.\"" The little horse allowed itself to be rubbed down without a toss of its head or a kick.\n\n\""Good gracious!\"" exclaimed the master. \""How is it that he lets you touch him when no one else can go near him?\"" \""Perhaps he knows me,\"" answered the stable-boy. A few days later, the master said to him, \""The Porcelain Maiden is here, but though she is as lovely as the dawn, she is so wicked that she scratches everyone who approaches her.\"" When the youth entered the room where she was, the Golden Blackbird broke forth into a joyful song, and the Porcelain Maiden sang too, jumping for joy. \""Good gracious!\"" cried the master. \""The Porcelain Maiden and the Golden Blackbird know you too?\"" \""Yes,\"" replied the youth, \""and the Porcelain Maiden can tell you the whole truth, if she only will.\""\n\nThen she recounted all that had happened and how she had consented to follow the young man who had captured the Golden Blackbird. \""Yes,\"" added the youth, \""I delivered my brothers, who were kept prisoners in an inn, and as a reward, they threw me into a lake. So I disguised myself and came here to prove the truth to you.\"" The old lord embraced his son, promising that he would inherit all his possessions, and he ordered the execution of the two elder brothers, who had deceived him and tried to slay their own brother. The young man married the Porcelain Maiden, and they celebrated a splendid wedding feast."""
31,The Sunchild,"""Once there was a woman who had no children, and this made her very unhappy. So she spoke one day to the Sunball, saying: \""Dear Sunball, send me only a little girl now, and when she is twelve years old you may take her back again.\"" Soon after this, the Sunball sent her a little girl, whom the woman called Letiko, and watched over with great care until she was twelve years old.\n\nOne day, while Letiko was away gathering herbs, the Sunball came to her and said: \""Letiko, when you go home, tell your mother that she must bethink herself of what she promised me.\"" Letiko went straight home and said to her mother: \""While I was gathering herbs, a fine tall gentleman came to me and charged me to tell you that you should remember what you promised him.\"" When the woman heard that, she was sore afraid and immediately shut all the doors and windows of the house, stopped up all the chinks and holes, and kept Letiko hidden away, fearing that the Sunball would come and take her away. However, she forgot to close up the keyhole, and through it, the Sunball sent a ray into the house, which took hold of the little girl and carried her away to him.\n\nOne day, the Sunball sent Letiko to the straw shed to fetch straw. The girl sat down on the piles of straw and bemoaned herself, saying: \""As sighs this straw under my feet, so sighs my heart after my mother.\"" This caused her to be so long away that the Sunball asked her when she came back: \""Eh, Letiko, where have you been so long?\"" She answered: \""My slippers are too big, and I could not go faster.\"" Then the Sunball made the slippers shorter.\n\nAnother time, he sent her to fetch water, and when she came to the spring, she sat down and lamented, saying: \""As flows the water, even so flows my heart with longing for my mother.\"" Thus, she again remained so long away that the Sunball asked her: \""Eh, Letiko, why have you remained so long away?\"" She answered: \""My petticoat is too long and hinders me in walking.\"" Then the Sunball cut her petticoat to make it shorter.\n\nAnother time, the Sunball sent her to bring him a pair of sandals, and as the girl carried these in her hand, she began to lament, saying: \""As creaks the leather, so creaks my heart after my little mother.\"" When she came home, the Sunball asked her again: \""Eh, Letiko, why do you come home so late?\"" She replied: \""My red hood is too wide and falls over my eyes; therefore, I could not go fast.\"" Then he made the hood narrower.\n\nAt last, however, the Sunball became aware of how sad Letiko was. He sent her a second time to bring straw, and slipping in after her, he heard how she lamented for her mother. Then he went home, called two foxes to him, and said: \""Will you take Letiko home?\"" They replied: \""Yes, why not?\"" He then asked: \""But what will you eat and drink if you should become hungry and thirsty by the way?\"" The foxes answered: \""We will eat her flesh and drink her blood.\"" When the Sunball heard that, he said: \""You are not suited for this affair.\"" \n\nThen he sent them away and called two hares to him, asking: \""Will you take Letiko home to her mother?\"" They replied: \""Yes, why not?\"" He inquired again: \""What will you eat and drink if you should become hungry and thirsty by the way?\"" The hares answered: \""We will eat grass and drink from streamlets.\"" \""Then take her, and bring her home,\"" the Sunball said.\n\nThe hares set out, taking Letiko with them, and because it was a long way to her home, they became hungry along the way. They said to the little girl: \""Climb this tree, dear Letiko, and remain there till we have finished eating.\"" So Letiko climbed the tree, and the hares went grazing. \n\nIt was not long before a lamia came under the tree and called out: \""Letiko, Letiko, come down and see what beautiful shoes I have on.\"" Letiko replied: \""Oh! my shoes are much finer than yours.\"" The lamia insisted: \""Come down. I am in a hurry, for my house is not yet swept.\"" Letiko retorted: \""Go home and sweep it then, and come back when you are ready.\"" \n\nThe lamia went away to sweep her house, and when she was ready, she returned and called out: \""Letiko, Letiko, come down and see what a beautiful apron I have.\"" Letiko answered: \""Oh! my apron is much finer than yours.\"" The lamia threatened: \""If you will not come down, I will cut down the tree and eat you.\"" Letiko boldly replied: \""Do so, and then eat me.\"" \n\nThe lamia hewed at the tree with all her strength but could not cut it down. Frustrated, she called out: \""Letiko, Letiko, come down, for I must feed my children.\"" Letiko said: \""Go home then and feed them, and come back when you are ready.\"" When the lamia was gone, Letiko called out: \""Little hares! little hares!\"" \n\nOne hare said to the other: \""Listen, Letiko is calling,\"" and they both ran back to her as fast as they could go. Letiko came down from the tree, and they continued on their way. The lamia ran as fast as she could after them, and when she came to a field where people were working, she asked: \""Have you seen anyone pass this way?\"" They answered: \""We are planting beans.\"" \n\nThe lamia, frustrated, replied: \""Oh! I did not ask about that; but if anyone had passed this way.\"" The people only answered louder: \""Are you deaf? It is beans, beans, beans we are planting.\"" When Letiko had nearly reached her home, the dog recognized her and called out, \""Bow wow! see here comes Letiko!\"" The mother, hearing this, said: \""Hush! thou beast of ill-omen! wilt thou make me burst with misery?\"" \n\nNext, the cat on the roof saw her and called out: \""Miaouw! miaouw! see here comes Letiko!\"" Again, the mother said: \""Keep silence! thou beast of ill-omen! wilt thou make me burst with misery?\"" Then the cock spied her and called out: \""Cock-a-doodle-do! see here comes Letiko!\"" The mother repeated: \""Be quiet! thou bird of ill-omen! wilt thou make me burst with misery?\"" \n\nAs Letiko and the two hares approached the house, the lamia was close behind. When the hare was about to slip in through the house door, she caught it by its little tail and tore it out. When the hare came in, the mother stood up and said to it: \""Welcome, dear little hare; because you have brought me back Letiko, I will silver your little tail.\"" And she did so, living ever after with her daughter in happiness and content."""
32,The War Of The Wolf And The Fox,"""There was once upon a time a man and his wife who had an old cat and an old dog. One day the man, whose name was Simon, said to his wife, whose name was Susan, \""Why should we keep our old cat any longer? She never catches any mice nowadays, and is so useless that I have made up my mind to drown her.\"" \n\nBut his wife replied, \""Don't do that, for I'm sure she could still catch mice.\"" \n\n\""Rubbish,\"" said Simon. \""The mice might dance on her and she would never catch one. I've quite made up my mind that the next time I see her, I shall put her in the water.\"" \n\nSusan was very unhappy when she heard this, and so was the cat, who had been listening to the conversation behind the stove. When Simon went off to his work, the poor cat miaowed so pitifully and looked up so pathetically into Susan's face that the woman quickly opened the door. She said, \""Fly for your life, my poor little beast, and get well away from here before your master returns.\"" \n\nThe cat took her advice and ran as quickly as her poor old legs would carry her into the wood. When Simon came home, his wife told him that the cat had vanished. \n\n\""So much the better for her,\"" said Simon. \""And now we have got rid of her, we must consider what we are to do with the old dog. He is quite deaf and blind, and invariably barks when there is no need, and makes no sound when there is. I think the best thing I can do with him is to hang him.\"" \n\nBut soft-hearted Susan replied, \""Please don't do so. He's surely not so useless as all that.\"" \n\n\""Don't be foolish,\"" said her husband. \""The courtyard might be full of thieves and he'd never discover it. No, the first time I see him, it's all up with him, I can tell you.\"" \n\nSusan was very unhappy at his words, and so was the dog, who was lying in the corner of the room and had heard everything. As soon as Simon had gone to his work, he stood up and howled so touchingly that Susan quickly opened the door. She said, \""Fly for your life, poor beast, before your master gets home.\"" And the dog ran into the wood with his tail between his legs. \n\nWhen her husband returned, his wife told him that the dog had disappeared. \n\n\""That's lucky for him,\"" said Simon, but Susan sighed, for she had been very fond of the poor creature. \n\nNow it happened that the cat and dog met each other on their travels. Though they had not been the best of friends at home, they were quite glad to meet among strangers. They sat down under a holly tree and both poured forth their woes. \n\nPresently a fox passed by and saw the pair sitting together in a disconsolate fashion. He asked them why they sat there and what they were grumbling about. \n\nThe cat replied, \""I have caught many a mouse in my day. Now that I am old and past work, my master wants to drown me.\"" \n\nAnd the dog said, \""Many a night have I watched and guarded my master's house. Now that I am old and deaf, he wants to hang me.\"" \n\nThe fox answered, \""That's the way of the world. But I'll help you to get back into your master's favour, only you must first help me in my own troubles.\"" \n\nThey promised to do their best, and the fox continued, \""The wolf has declared war against me, and is at this moment marching to meet me in company with the bear and the wild boar. Tomorrow there will be a fierce battle between us.\"" \n\n\""All right,\"" said the dog and the cat, \""we will stand by you, and if we are killed, it is at any rate better to die on the field of battle than to perish ignobly at home,\"" and they shook paws and concluded the bargain. The fox sent word to the wolf to meet him at a certain place, and the three set forth to encounter him and his friends. \n\nThe wolf, the bear, and the wild boar arrived on the spot first, and when they had waited some time for the fox, the dog, and the cat, the bear said, \""I'll climb up into the oak tree, and look if I can see them coming.\"" \n\nThe first time he looked round he said, \""I can see nothing.\"" The second time he looked round he said, \""I can still see nothing.\"" But the third time he said, \""I see a mighty army in the distance, and one of the warriors has the biggest lance you ever saw!\"" \n\nThis was the cat, who was marching along with her tail erect. And so they laughed and jeered, and it was so hot that the bear said, \""The enemy won't be here at this rate for many hours to come. I'll just curl myself up in the fork of the tree and have a little sleep.\"" \n\nAnd the wolf lay down under the oak, and the wild boar buried himself in some straw, so that nothing was seen of him but one ear. \n\nAnd while they were lying there, the fox, the cat, and the dog arrived. When the cat saw the wild boar's ear, she pounced upon it, thinking it was a mouse in the straw. \n\nThe wild boar got up in a dreadful fright, gave one loud grunt, and disappeared into the wood. But the cat was even more startled than the boar, and, spitting with terror, she scrambled up into the fork of the tree, and as it happened, right into the bear's face. Now it was the bear's turn to be alarmed, and with a mighty growl, he jumped down from the oak and fell right on the top of the wolf and killed him as dead as a stone. \n\nOn their way home from the war, the fox caught a score of mice, and when they reached Simon's cottage, he put them all on the stove and said to the cat, \""Now go and fetch one mouse after the other, and lay them down before your master.\"" \n\n\""All right,\"" said the cat, and did exactly as the fox told her. \n\nWhen Susan saw this, she said to her husband, \""Just look, here is our old cat back again, and see what a lot of mice she has caught.\"" \n\n\""Wonders will never cease,\"" cried Simon. \""I certainly never thought the old cat would ever catch another mouse.\"" \n\nBut Susan answered, \""There, you see, I always said our cat was a most excellent creature\u2014but you men always think you know best.\"" \n\nIn the meantime, the fox said to the dog, \""Our friend Simon has just killed a pig. When it gets a little darker, you must go into the courtyard and bark with all your might.\"" \n\n\""All right,\"" said the dog, and as soon as it grew dusk, he began to bark loudly. \n\nSusan, who heard him first, said to her husband, \""Our dog must have come back, for I hear him barking lustily. Do go out and see what's the matter. Perhaps thieves may be stealing our sausages.\"" \n\nBut Simon answered, \""The foolish brute is as deaf as a post and is always barking at nothing,\"" and he refused to get up. \n\nThe next morning, Susan got up early to go to church at the neighbouring town, and she thought she would take some sausages to her aunt who lived there. But when she went to her larder, she found all the sausages gone, and a great hole in the floor. She called out to her husband, \""I was perfectly right. Thieves have been here last night, and they have not left a single sausage. Oh! if you had only got up when I asked you to!\"" \n\nThen Simon scratched his head and said, \""I can't understand it at all. I certainly never believed the old dog was so quick at hearing.\"" \n\nBut Susan replied, \""I always told you our old dog was the best dog in the world\u2014but as usual, you thought you knew so much better. Men are the same all the world over.\"" \n\nAnd the fox scored a point too, for he had carried away the sausages himself!"""
35,Fox Fire,"""Once upon a time, there was a strong young farmer who came home late one evening from the market. His way led him past the gardens of a wealthy gentleman, in which stood a number of tall buildings. Suddenly, he saw something shining and floating in the air inside the gardens, something that glowed like a ball of crystal. He was astonished and climbed the wall surrounding the gardens, but there was not a human being in sight. All he saw, at a distance, was something that appeared to be a dog, looking up at the moon. Whenever it blew its breath out, a ball of fire came out of its mouth and rose to the moon. Conversely, whenever it drew its breath in, the ball sank down again, and it caught it in its jaws. This mesmerizing spectacle continued without a stop.\n\nThe farmer soon realized that it was a fox preparing the elixir of life. He hid in the grass and waited until the ball of fire came down again, at about the height of his own head. Then, he stepped hastily from his hiding place, took it away, and at once swallowed it. He could feel it glow as it passed down his throat into his stomach. When the fox saw what had happened, he grew angry and looked furiously at the farmer. However, fearing the farmer's strength, he did not dare to attack him and went angrily on his way.\n\nFrom that time on, the farmer-boy could make himself invisible, see ghosts and devils, and had intercourse with the spirit world. In cases of sickness, when people lay unconscious, he could call back their souls, and if someone had committed a sin, he could plead for them. Thanks to these extraordinary gifts, he earned much money and gained a reputation in his community.\n\nAs the years passed, the farmer reached his fiftieth year and decided to withdraw from all things, choosing no longer to exercise his arts. One summer evening, he was sitting in his courtyard, enjoying the cool air. While there, he drank several goblets of wine and, by midnight, had fallen fast asleep. Suddenly, he awoke feeling ill, as though someone were patting him on the back. Before he knew it, the ball of fire had leaped out from his throat.\n\nAt that moment, a hand reached for it, and a voice said, \""For thirty long years, you kept my treasure from me, and from a poor farmer lad, you have grown to be a wealthy man. Now you have enough, and I would like to have my fire-ball back again!\"" The man realized what had happened, but the fox was gone, leaving him to ponder the consequences of his actions."""
36,Help In Need,"""Some twenty miles east of Gingdschou lies the Lake of the Maidens. It is several miles square and surrounded on all sides by thick green thickets and tall forests. Its waters are clear and dark-blue. Often, all kinds of wondrous creatures show themselves in the lake. The people of the vicinity have erected a temple there for the Dragon Princess, and in times of drought, all make pilgrimage there to offer up prayers.\n\nWest of Gingdschou, two hundred miles away, is another lake, whose god is named Tschauna, and who performs many miracles. During the time of the Tang dynasty, there lived in Gingdschou a mandarin by the name of Dschou Bau. While he was in office, it chanced that in the fifth month, clouds suddenly arose in the sky, piling themselves up like mountains, among which wriggled dragons and serpents. They rolled up and down between the two seas. Tempest and rain, thunder and lightning arose, causing houses to fall to pieces, trees to be torn up by the roots, and much damage to be done to the crops. Dschou Bau took the blame upon himself and prayed to the heavens that his people might be pardoned.\n\nOn the fifth day of the sixth month, Dschou Bau sat in his hall of audience and gave judgment. Suddenly, he felt quite weary and sleepy. He took off his hat and laid down on the cushions. No sooner had he closed his eyes than he saw a warrior in helmet and armor, with a halberd in his hand, standing on the steps leading to the hall, who announced, \""A lady is waiting outside who wishes to enter!\"" Dschou Bau asked him, \""Who are you?\"" The answer was, \""I am your door-keeper. In the invisible world, I have already been performing this duty for many years.\"" Meanwhile, two figures clad in green came up the steps, knelt before him, and said, \""Our mistress has come to visit you!\"" Dschou Bau rose. He beheld lovely clouds, from which fell a fine rain, and strange fragrances enchanted him. Suddenly, he saw a lady clad in a simple gown, but of surpassing beauty, float down from on high, with a retinue of many female servants. These were all neat and clean in appearance and waited upon the lady as though she were a princess. When the latter entered the hall, she raised her arms in greeting. Dschou Bau came forward to meet her and invited her to be seated.\n\nFrom all sides, bright-colored clouds came floating in, and the courtyard was filled with a purple ether. Dschou Bau had wine and food brought and entertained them all in the most splendid way. However, the goddess sat staring straight before her with wrinkled brows and seemed to feel very sad. Then she rose and said with a blush, \""I have been living in this neighborhood for many years. A wrong which has been done to me permits me to pass the bounds of what is fitting and encourages me to ask a favor of you. Yet I do not know whether you wish to save me!\""\n\n\""May I hear what it is all about,\"" answered Dschou Bau. \""If I can help you, I will be glad to place myself at your disposal.\"" The goddess explained her plight, detailing how her family had been living in the depths of the Eastern Sea for hundreds of years but had faced misfortune due to the jealousy of men. She recounted how her ancestors had to flee and hide themselves, and how her father had done much good to mankind, earning him great honor. She revealed that she was his ninth daughter and had been married to the youngest son of the Rock-Dragon, but he had met a tragic end due to his fiery temper. \n\n\""My father wished me to marry again; but I had promised to remain true to the memory of my husband and made a vow not to comply with my father's wish. My parents grew angry, and I was obliged to retire to this place in view of their anger. That was three years ago. Who could imagine that the contemptible dragon Tschauna, who was seeking a wife for his youngest brother, would try to force the wedding-gift upon me? I refused to accept it; but Tschauna knew how to gain his point with my father and was determined to carry out his intention. My father, regardless of my wishes, promised me to him. And then the dragon Tschauna appeared with his youngest brother and wanted to carry me off by sheer force of arms. I encountered him with fifty faithful followers, and we fought on the meadow before the city. We were defeated, and I am more than ever afraid that Tschauna will attempt to drag me off. So I have plucked up courage to beg you to lend me your mercenaries so that I may beat off my foes and remain as I am. If you will help me, I will be grateful to you till the end of my days.\""\n\nDschou Bau answered, \""You come from a noble family. Have you no kinsfolk who will hasten to help you in your need, that you are compelled to turn to a mortal man?\"" The goddess explained that while her kinsfolk were numerous and powerful, her deceased husband's offense against the heavens had not yet been pardoned, and her parents' will opposed hers, preventing her from calling upon them for help. Understanding her plight, Dschou Bau promised to assist her, and the princess thanked him before departing.\n\nWhen he awoke, he sighed long, thinking over his strange experience. The following day, he sent off fifteen hundred soldiers to stand guard by the Lake of the Maidens. On the seventh day of the sixth month, Dschou Bau rose early. Darkness still lay before the windows, yet it seemed to him as though he could glimpse a man before the curtain. He asked who it might be. The man said, \""I am the princess's adviser. Yesterday you were kind enough to send soldiers to aid us in our distress. But they were all living men, and such cannot fight against invisible spirits. You will have to send us soldiers of yours who have died if you wish to aid us.\""\n\nDschou Bau reflected for a time and realized the truth in the adviser\u2019s words. He had his field-secretary examine the roster to see how many of his soldiers had fallen in battle. The latter counted up to some two thousand foot-soldiers and five hundred horsemen. Dschou Bau appointed his deceased officer Mong Yuan as their leader and wrote his commands on a paper which he burned, in order to place them at the princess's disposal. The living soldiers he recalled. When they were being reviewed in the courtyard after their return, a soldier suddenly fell unconscious. It was not until early the following morning that he came to his senses again.\n\nHe was questioned and replied, \""I saw a man clad in red who approached me and said: 'Our princess is grateful for the aid your master has so kindly given her. Yet she still has a request to make and has asked me to call you.' I followed him to the temple. The princess bade me come forward and said to me: 'I thank your master from my heart for sending me the ghost soldiers, but Mong Yuan, their leader, is incapable. Yesterday the robbers came with three thousand men, and Mong Yuan was beaten by them. When you return and again see your master, say that I earnestly beg him to send me a good general. Perhaps that will save me in my need.' Then she had me led back again, and I regained consciousness.\""\n\nWhen Dschou Bau heard these words, which seemed to fit strangely well with what he had dreamed, he thought he would try to see if this were really the case. Therefore, he chose his victorious general Dschong Tschong-Fu to take the place of Mong Yuan. That evening, he burned incense, offered wine, and handed over to the princess this captain's soul. On the twenty-sixth of the month, news came from the general's camp that he had suddenly died at midnight on the thirteenth. Dschou Bau was frightened and sent a man to bring him a report. The latter informed him that the general's heart had hardly ceased to beat, and that, in spite of the hot summer weather, his body was free from any trace of decay. So the order was given not to bury him.\n\nThen one night, an icy, spectral wind arose, which whirled up sand and stones, broke trees, and tore down houses. The standing corn in the fields was blown down. The storm lasted all day. Finally, the crash of a terrific thunderbolt was heard, and then the skies cleared and the clouds scattered. That very hour, the dead general began to breathe painfully on his couch, and when his attendants came to him, he had returned to life again.\n\nThey questioned him, and he told them, \""First I saw a man in a purple gown riding a black horse, who came up with a great retinue. He dismounted before the door. In his hand, he held a decree of appointment which he gave me, saying: 'Our princess begs you most respectfully to become her general. I hope that you will not refuse.' Then he brought forth gifts and heaped them up before the steps. Jade-stones, brocades, and silken garments, saddles, horses, helmets, and suits of mail\u2014he heaped them all up in the courtyard. I wished to decline, but this he would not allow, and urged me to enter his chariot with him. We drove a hundred miles and met a train of three hundred armored horsemen who had ridden out to escort me. They led me to a great city, and before the city, a tent had been erected in which played a band of musicians. A high official welcomed me.\n\nWhen I entered the city, the onlookers were crowded together like walls. Servants ran to and fro bearing orders. We passed through more than a dozen gates before we reached the princess. There I was requested to dismount and change my clothes in order to enter the presence of the princess, for she wished to receive me as her guest. But I thought this too great an honor and greeted her below, on the steps. She, however, invited me to seat myself near her in the hall. She sat upright in all her incomparable beauty, surrounded by female attendants adorned with the richest jewels. These plucked lute-strings and played flutes. A throng of servitors stood about in golden girdles with purple tassels, ready to carry out her commands. Countless crowds were assembled before the palace. Five or six visitors sat in a circle about the princess, and a general led me to my place. The princess said to me, 'I have begged you to come here in order to entrust the command of my army to you. If you will break the power of my foe, I will reward you richly.' I promised to obey her. Then wine was brought in, and the banquet was served to the sound of music. While we were at table, a messenger entered: 'The robber Tschauna has invaded our land with ten thousand footmen and horsemen, and is approaching our city by various roads. His way is marked by columns of fire and smoke!' The guests all grew pale with terror when they heard the news. And the princess said, 'This is the foe because of whom I have sought your aid. Save me in my hour of need!' Then she gave me two chargers, a suit of golden armor, and the insignia of a commander-in-chief, and bowed to me. I thanked her and went, called together the captains, had the army mustered, and rode out before the city. At several decisive points, I placed troops in ambush. The enemy was already approaching in great force, careless and unconcerned, intoxicated by his former victories. I sent out my most untrustworthy soldiers in advance, who allowed themselves to be beaten in order to lure him on. Light-armed men then went out against him and retreated in skirmish order. And thus he fell into my ambush. Drums and kettledrums sounded together, the ring closed around them on all sides, and the robber army suffered a grievous defeat. The dead lay about like hemp-stalks, but little Tschauna succeeded in breaking through the circle.\n\nI sent out the light horsemen after him, and they seized him before the tent of the enemy's commanding general. Hastily, I sent word to the princess, and she reviewed the prisoners before the palace. All the people, high and low, streamed together to acclaim her. Little Tschauna was about to be executed in the marketplace when a messenger came spurring up with a command from the princess's father to pardon him. The princess did not dare to disobey. So he was dismissed to his home after he had sworn to give up all thought of realizing his traitorous plans. I was loaded with benefits as a reward for my victory. I was invested with an estate with three thousand peasants and was given a palace, horses and wagons, all sorts of jewels, men-servants and women-servants, gardens and forests, banners and suits of mail.\n\nAnd my subordinate officers, too, were duly rewarded. On the following day, a banquet was held, and the princess herself filled a goblet, sent it to me by one of her attendants, and said, 'Widowed early in life, I opposed the wishes of my stern father and fled to this spot. Here the infamous Tschauna harassed me and well-nigh put me to shame. Had not your master's great kindness and your own courage come to my assistance, hard would have been my lot!' Then she began to thank me, and her tears of emotion flowed like a stream. I bowed and begged her to grant me leave of absence so that I might look after my family. I was given a month's leave, and the following day she dismissed me with a splendid retinue. Before the city, a pavilion had been erected in which I drank the stirrup-cup. Then I rode away, and when I arrived before our own gate, a thunder-peal crashed, and I awoke.\""\n\nThereupon, the general wrote an account of what had happened to Dschou Bau, in which he conveyed the princess's thanks. Then he paid no further heed to worldly matters but set his house in order and turned it over to his wife and son. When a month had passed, he died without any sign of illness.\n\nThat same day, one of his officers was out walking. Suddenly, he saw a heavy cloud of dust rising along the highway, while flags and banners darkened the sun. A thousand knights were escorting a man who sat his horse proudly and like a hero. When the officer looked at his face, it was the general Dschong Tschong-Fu. Hastily, he stepped to the edge of the road in order to allow the cavalcade to pass and watched it ride by. The horsemen took the way to the Lake of the Maidens, where they disappeared."""
38,Laotsze,"""Laotsze is really older than heaven and earth put together. He is the Yellow Lord or Ancient, who created this world together with the other four. At various times, he has appeared on earth under different names. His most celebrated incarnation, however, is that of Laotsze, \""The Old Child,\"" a name he was given because he made his appearance on earth with white hair.\n\nHe acquired all sorts of magic powers by means of which he extended his life-span. Once, he hired a servant to do his bidding, agreeing to pay him a hundred pieces of copper daily. However, he did not pay him, and eventually, he owed him seven million, two hundred thousand pieces of copper. Laotsze then mounted a black steer and rode to the West, intending to take his servant along. But when they reached the Han-Gu pass, the servant refused to go further and insisted on being paid. Yet Laotsze gave him nothing.\n\nAs they approached the house of the guardian of the pass, red clouds appeared in the sky. The guardian understood this sign and knew that a holy man was drawing near. He went out to meet Laotsze and took him into his house. The guardian questioned him about hidden knowledge, but Laotsze only stuck out his tongue at him and remained silent. Nevertheless, the guardian treated him with the greatest respect in his home. Meanwhile, Laotsze's servant told the guardian's servant about the large sum of money owed to him and begged for assistance.\n\nWhen the guardian's servant heard how much Laotsze owed, he was tempted to win such a wealthy man for a son-in-law and arranged for his marriage to his daughter. Eventually, the guardian learned of this arrangement and approached Laotsze along with the servant. Laotsze then addressed his servant, saying, \""You rascally servant. You really should have been dead long ago. I hired you, and since I was poor and could give you no money, I gave you a life-giving talisman to eat. That is how you still happen to be alive. I said to you: 'If you will follow me into the West, the land of Blessed Repose, I will pay you your wages in yellow gold. But you did not wish to do this.'\"" With that, he patted his servant's neck, causing the latter to open his mouth and spit out the life-giving talisman. The magic signs written on it with cinnabar were still fresh and well-preserved, but suddenly, the servant collapsed and turned into a heap of dry bones.\n\nThe guardian of the pass then cast himself to the ground and pleaded for the servant. He promised to pay the servant for Laotsze and begged the latter to restore him to life. In response, Laotsze placed the talisman among the bones, and at once, the servant came to life again. The guardian paid him his wages and dismissed him. Grateful, he adored Laotsze as his master, who then taught him the art of eternal life and left him his teachings in five thousand words, which the guardian wrote down. This book, which thus came into being, is the Tao Teh King, \""The Book of the Way and Life.\"" After imparting his wisdom, Laotsze disappeared from the eyes of men, while the guardian of the pass followed his teachings and was granted a place among the immortals."""
42,The Fire God,"""Long before the time of Fu Hi, Dschu Yung, the Magic Welder, was the ruler of men. He discovered the use of fire, and succeeding generations learned from him to cook their food. Hence, his descendants were entrusted with the preservation of fire, while he himself was made the Fire-God. He is a personification of the Red Lord, who showed himself at the beginning of the world as one of the Five Ancients. The Fire-God is worshiped as the Lord of the Holy Southern Mountain. In the skies, the Fiery Star, the southern quarter of the heavens, and the Red Bird belong to his domain. When there is danger of fire, the Fiery Star glows with a peculiar radiance. When countless numbers of fire-crows fly into a house, a fire is sure to break out in it.\n\nIn the land of the four rivers, there dwelt a man who was very rich. One day, he got into his wagon and set out on a long journey. Along the way, he met a girl dressed in red, who begged him to take her with him. He allowed her to get into the wagon and drove along for half a day without even looking in her direction. Then the girl got out again and said in farewell, \""You are truly a good and honest man, and for that reason, I must tell you the truth. I am the Fire-God. Tomorrow a fire will break out in your house. Hurry home at once to arrange your affairs and save what you can!\""\n\nFrightened, the man faced his horses about and drove home as fast as he could. He removed all that he possessed in the way of treasures, clothes, and jewels from the house. Just as he was about to lie down to sleep, a fire broke out on the hearth that could not be quenched until the whole building had collapsed in dust and ashes. Yet, thanks to the Fire-God, the man had saved all his movable belongings."""
43,The Flying Ogre,"""There once lived in Sianfu an old Buddhist monk, who loved to wander in lonely places. In the course of his wanderings, he once came to the Kuku-Nor, and there he saw a tree that was a thousand feet high and many cords in breadth. It was hollow inside, and one could see the sky shining down into it from above.\n\nAs he continued on his journey, he saw in the distance a girl in a red coat, barefoot, and with unbound hair, who was running as fast as the wind. In a moment, she stood before him, pleading, \""Take pity on me and save my life!\"" When the monk asked her what the trouble was, she replied, \""A man is pursuing me. If you will tell him you have not seen me, I will be grateful to you all my life long!\"" With that, she ran up to the hollow tree and crawled into it.\n\nAfter the girl disappeared into the tree, the monk continued on his path. Soon, he encountered a man riding an armored steed. The stranger wore a garment of gold, a bow slung across his shoulders, and a sword hung at his side. His horse ran with the speed of lightning, covering a couple of miles with every step, whether it ran in the air or on the ground.\n\n\""Have you seen the girl in the red coat?\"" asked the stranger. When the monk replied that he had seen nothing, the other continued, \""Bonze, you should not lie! This girl is not a human being, but a flying ogre. Of flying ogres, there are thousands of varieties, who bring ruin to people everywhere. I have already slain a countless number of them and have pretty well done away with them. But this one is the worst of all. Last night, the Lord of the Heavens gave me a triple command, and that is the reason I have hurried down from the skies. There are eight thousand of us under way in all directions to catch this monster. If you do not tell the truth, monk, then you are sinning against heaven itself!\""\n\nUpon hearing this, the monk did not dare deceive him and pointed to the hollow tree. The messenger of the skies dismounted, stepped into the tree, and looked about him. After a moment, he mounted his horse again, which carried him up the hollow trunk and out at the end of the tree. The monk looked up and saw a small, red flame come out of the tree-top, followed by the messenger of the skies. Both rose up to the clouds and disappeared. After a time, a rain of blood fell, indicating that the ogre had probably been hit by an arrow or captured.\n\nAfterward, the monk told the tale to a scholar who wrote it down, preserving the story of the old monk, the girl in the red coat, and the swift messenger of the skies."""
45,The Lady Of The Moon,"""In the days of the Emperor Yau, there lived a prince named Hou I, who was renowned as a mighty hero and an exceptional archer. One fateful day, ten suns rose together in the sky, shining so brightly and burning so fiercely that the people on earth could not endure the heat. In response to this dire situation, the Emperor ordered Hou I to shoot down the excess suns. With his remarkable skill, Hou I managed to shoot down nine of them, restoring balance to the world. Alongside his impressive bow, Hou I possessed a horse that ran so swiftly that even the wind could not catch up with it.\n\nOne day, while mounted on his swift horse, Hou I set out for a hunting expedition. However, the horse ran away uncontrollably, leading him to Kunlun Mountain. There, he encountered the Queen-Mother of the Jasper Sea, who bestowed upon him the herb of immortality. Excited by this gift, Hou I took the herb home and hid it in his room. Unfortunately, his wife, Tschang O, discovered the herb and, tempted by its power, ate some of it in secret while Hou I was away. As a result, she floated up to the clouds and eventually reached the moon, where she found refuge in a castle and has lived there ever since as the Lady of the Moon.\n\nOn a night in mid-autumn, an emperor of the Tang dynasty sat at wine with two sorcerers. During their gathering, one of the sorcerers took his bamboo staff and cast it into the air, transforming it into a heavenly bridge. The three of them climbed up to the moon together, where they encountered a magnificent castle inscribed with the words: \""The Spreading Halls of Crystal Cold.\"" Beside the castle stood a cassia tree, which blossomed and filled the air with its enchanting fragrance. In the tree, they spotted a man chopping off smaller boughs with an ax.\n\nOne of the sorcerers explained, \""That is the man in the moon. The cassia tree grows so luxuriantly that, over time, it would overshadow all the moon's radiance. Therefore, it must be cut down once every thousand years.\"" Intrigued, they entered the spreading halls of the castle, where silver stories towered above them, and the walls and columns were made of liquid crystal. Within the walls were cages and ponds, where fish and birds moved as if alive, creating an ethereal atmosphere that made the entire moon-world seem like glass.\n\nWhile they were still marveling at their surroundings, the Lady of the Moon approached them, adorned in a white mantle and a rainbow-colored gown. She smiled warmly at the emperor and said, \""You are a prince of the mundane world of dust. Great is your fortune, since you have been able to find your way here!\"" She then called for her attendants, who arrived flying on white birds, and they began to sing and dance beneath the cassia tree. A pure, clear music floated through the air, enchanting all who heard it. Beside the tree stood a mortar made of white marble, where a jasper rabbit ground up herbs, representing the dark half of the moon.\n\nAfter the dance concluded, the emperor returned to earth with the sorcerers, carrying with him the melodies he had heard on the moon. He had the songs written down and performed them in his pear-tree garden, accompanied by flutes made of jasper, sharing the beauty of the moon's music with the world below."""
46,The Miserly Farmer,"""Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had carted pears to market. Since they were very sweet and fragrant, he hoped to get a good price for them. A bonze with a torn cap and tattered robe stepped up to his cart and asked for one. The farmer repulsed him, but the bonze did not go. Then the farmer grew angry and began to call him names. The bonze said, \""You have pears by the hundred in your cart. I only ask for one. Surely that does you no great injury. Why suddenly grow so angry about it?\""\n\nThe bystanders told the farmer that he ought to give the bonze one of the smaller pears and let him go. But the farmer would not and did not. An artisan saw the whole affair from his shop, and since the noise annoyed him, he took some money, bought a pear, and gave it to the bonze. The bonze thanked him and said, \""One like myself, who has given up the world, must not be miserly. I have beautiful pears myself, and I invite you all to eat them with me.\"" Then someone asked, \""If you have pears, then why do you not eat your own?\"" He answered, \""I first must have a seed to plant.\""\n\nWith that, he began to eat the pear with gusto. When he had finished, he held the pit in his hand, took his pick-ax from his shoulder, and dug a hole a couple of inches deep. Into this, he thrust the pit and covered it with earth. Then he asked the folk in the marketplace for water, with which to water it. A pair of curiosity seekers brought him hot water from the hostelry in the street, and with it, the bonze watered the pit. Thousands of eyes were turned on the spot, and the pit could already be seen to sprout. The sprout grew, and in a moment, it had turned into a tree. Branches and leaves burgeoned out from it. It began to blossom, and soon the fruit had ripened: large, fragrant pears, which hung in thick clusters from the boughs.\n\nThe bonze climbed into the tree and handed down the pears to the bystanders. In a moment, all the pears had been eaten up. Then the bonze took his pick-ax and cut down the tree. Crash, crash! So it went for a while, and the tree was felled. Then he took the tree on his shoulder and walked away at an easy gait.\n\nWhen the bonze had begun to make his magic, the farmer, too, had mingled with the crowd. With neck outstretched and staring eyes, he had stood there and had entirely forgotten the business he hoped to do with his pears. When the bonze had gone off, he turned around to look after his cart. His pears had all disappeared. Then he realized that the pears the bonze had divided had been his own. He looked more closely, and the axle of his cart had disappeared. It was plainly evident that it had been chopped off quite recently.\n\nThe farmer fell into a rage and hastened after the bonze as fast as ever he could. When he turned the corner, there lay the missing piece from the axle by the city wall. And then he realized that the pear tree which the bonze had chopped down must have been his axle. The bonze, however, was nowhere to be found. The whole crowd in the market burst out into loud laughter."""
49,Why Dog And Cat Are Enemies,"""Once upon a time, there was a man and his wife who owned a ring of gold. This ring was said to be lucky, ensuring that whoever possessed it would always have enough to live on. However, unaware of its significance, they sold the ring for a small sum. No sooner had they parted with it than their fortunes began to decline. They grew poorer and poorer, eventually facing uncertainty about when they would have their next meal. Their dog and cat, who also suffered from the lack of food, decided to devise a plan to restore their owners' former good fortune.\n\nAfter much deliberation, the dog proposed a solution. \""They must have the ring back again,\"" he said to the cat. The cat, however, pointed out that the ring was securely locked away in a chest, making it inaccessible. The dog then suggested, \""You must catch a mouse. The mouse can gnaw a hole in the chest and retrieve the ring. If she hesitates, threaten to bite her, and I assure you she will comply.\"" The cat found this advice appealing and promptly caught a mouse.\n\nWith the mouse in tow, the cat and dog set off towards the house where the chest was kept. Their journey was interrupted by a broad river, which posed a challenge for the cat, who could not swim. The dog, ever resourceful, offered to carry her on his back and swam across the river with her. Once they reached the other side, the cat took the mouse to the house containing the chest. The mouse quickly gnawed a hole in the chest and retrieved the ring. The cat, with the ring in her mouth, returned to the river where the dog was waiting and swam back across.\n\nTogether, they began their journey home to present the lucky ring to their master and mistress. However, the dog faced obstacles along the way, as he could only run on the ground and had to navigate around houses. In contrast, the cat swiftly climbed over rooftops, allowing her to reach home long before the dog. She proudly presented the ring to her master, who exclaimed, \""What a good creature the cat is! We will always give her enough to eat and care for her as though she were our own child!\""\n\nWhen the dog finally returned home, he was met with scolding and punishment for not helping to bring back the ring. Meanwhile, the cat sat by the fireplace, purring contentedly and saying nothing. This unfair treatment ignited anger in the dog, who felt robbed of his reward. In a fit of jealousy, he chased the cat, attempting to seize her.\n\nFrom that day forward, the cat and dog became enemies, their friendship shattered by jealousy and misunderstanding."""
50,Black Sheep,"""It was a bright spring day, and the sun shone very warm and pleasant over the pastures, where the new grass was growing so juicy and tender that all the sheep thought they had never tasted anything so delicious. The sheep had had a strange experience that morning, for the farmer had taken them down to the brook and washed them, and then he tied their legs together and laid them on the grass, clipping all the heavy, soft wool from their bodies with a great pair of shears.\n\nThe sheep did not like this very well, for every once in a while the shears would pull the wool and hurt them. When they were sheared, they felt very strange, as if someone had taken off all their clothes and let them run around naked. None of them were in a very good temper that morning, although the sun shone so warmly and the grass was so sweet. As they watched the farmer and his man carry their wool up to the house in great bags, the old ram said crossly, \""I hope they are satisfied, now that they have stolen from us all our soft, warm fleece.\""\n\n\""What are they going to do with it?\"" asked one of the sheep. The ram replied, \""Oh, they will spin it into threads and make coats for the men and dresses for the women. For men are such strange creatures that no wool grows on them at all, and that is why they selfishly rob us of our fleece to cover their own skinny bodies!\"" \n\n\""It must be horrid to be a man,\"" said the Black Sheep, \""and not to have any wool grow on you at all. I'm sorry for that little boy that lives in the lane, for he will never be able to keep warm unless we give him some of our wool.\"" The ram continued, \""But what a shame it is for the farmer to steal all the wool from us when we have taken all the trouble to grow it!\""\n\n\""I don't mind,\"" bleated a young lamb named Frisky, as it kicked up its heels and gambolled about upon the grass. \""It's nice to have all that heavy wool cut off my back, for I sha'n't have to carry it around wherever I go.\"" The ram sneered, \""Oh, indeed! You like it, do you? Have you any idea what you look like, all sheared down to your skin? How would you like to have someone come along and see you, now that you are all head and legs?\""\n\n\""Oh, I wouldn't mind,\"" said the lamb again. \""I shall grow more wool by winter-time, and I'm sure I don't look any worse than you do.\"" Some of the sheep looked at the ram and began to giggle, for he was old and thin, and looked very comical indeed without any wool. This made him so angry that he went off by himself and began eating grass, refusing to speak to the others at all.\n\n\""I don't know why sheep should feel badly about having their fleeces cut,\"" remarked the Black Sheep thoughtfully, \""for the farmer is very kind to us, and so is his dame. I am glad my wool serves to keep them warm in the winter. Before the snow comes, our wool will grow out again, and we shall not be any the worse for our loss.\"" \n\n\""What do those people who haven't any sheep do for clothes?\"" asked the lamb. \""I'm sure I don't know. They must nearly freeze in the winter. Perhaps the ram can tell us.\"" But the ram was still angry and refused to say anything, so the sheep stopped talking and began to scatter over the pasture to eat the tender, new grass.\n\nBy and by, the Black Sheep wandered near the lane and, looking up, saw the little boy watching it through the bars. \""Good morning, Black Sheep,\"" said the boy; \""why do you look so funny this morning?\"" \""They have cut off my wool,\"" answered the sheep. \""What will they do with it, Black Sheep?\"" enquired the little boy. \""They will make coats of it, to keep themselves warm.\""\n\n\""I wish I had some wool,\"" said the boy, \""for I need a new coat very badly, and mamma is so poor she cannot buy me one.\"" \""That is too bad,\"" replied the Black Sheep; \""but I shall have more wool by and by, and then I will give you a bagful to make a new coat from.\"" \""Will you really?\"" asked the boy, looking very much pleased. \""Indeed I will,\"" answered the sheep, \""for you are always kind and have a pleasant word for me. So you watch until my wool grows again, and then you shall have your share of it.\""\n\n\""Oh, thank you!\"" said the boy, and he ran away to tell his mother what the Black Sheep had said. When the farmer came into the field again, the Black Sheep said to him, \""Master, how many bags of wool did you cut from my back?\"" \""Two bags full,\"" replied the farmer; \""and it was very nice wool indeed.\"" \n\n\""If I grow three bags full the next time, may I have one bag for myself?\"" asked the sheep. \""Why, what could you do with a bag of wool?\"" questioned the farmer. \""I want to give it to the little boy that lives in the lane. He is very poor and needs a new coat.\"" \""Very well,\"" answered the master; \""if you can grow three bags full, I will give one to the little boy.\""\n\nSo the Black Sheep began to grow wool and tried in every way to grow the finest and heaviest fleece in all the flock. She always lay in the sunniest part of the pastures, drank from the clearest part of the brook, and ate only the young and juicy shoots of grass and the tenderest of the sheep-sorrel. Each day, the little boy came to the bars and looked at the sheep, inquiring how the wool was growing. \""I am getting along finely,\"" the Black Sheep would answer, \""for not one sheep in the pasture has so much wool as I have grown already.\""\n\n\""Can I do anything to help you?\"" asked the little boy. \""Not that I think of,\"" replied the sheep, \""unless you could get me a little salt. I believe salt helps the wool to grow.\"" So the boy ran to the house and begged his mother for a handful of salt, and then he came back to the bars, where the Black Sheep licked it out of his hand.\n\nDay by day, the wool on the sheep grew longer and longer, and even the old ram noticed it. He said, \""You are foolish to grow so much wool, for the farmer will cut it all off, and it will do you no good. Now I am growing just as little as possible, for since he steals what I have, I am determined he shall get very little wool from my back.\"" The Black Sheep did not reply to this, for she thought the old ram very ill-tempered and selfish, believing he was doing wrong not to grow more wool.\n\nFinally, the time came to shear the sheep again. The farmer and his man came into the pasture to look at them and were surprised to see what a fine, big fleece the Black Sheep had grown. \""There will be three bagsful at the least,\"" said the master, \""and I will keep my promise and give one to the little boy in the lane. But, my goodness! how scraggly and poor the old ram looks. There is scarcely any wool on him at all. I think I must sell him to the butcher!\"" \n\nIn truth, although the ram kicked and struggled and bleated with rage, they tied his legs and put him into the cart, carrying him away to the butcher. That was the last the sheep ever saw of him. But the Black Sheep ran up to the bars by the lane and waited with a glad heart until the little boy came. When he saw the sheep waiting for him, he asked, \""Black Sheep, Black Sheep, have you any wool?\"" And the sheep replied, \""Yes, my little master, three bags full!\""\n\n\""That is fine!\"" said the boy; \""but who are the three bags for?\"" \""One for my master, one for his dame, and one for the little boy that lives in the lane.\"" \""Thank you, Black Sheep,\"" said the little boy; \""you are very kind, and I shall always think of you when I wear my new coat.\""\n\nThe next day, the sheep were all sheared, and the Black Sheep's fleece made three big bagsful. The farmer kept his promise and carried one bag to the little boy that lived in the lane, and the wool was so soft and so heavy that there was enough not only for the new coat but to make his mother a warm dress as well. The Black Sheep was very proud and happy when the mother and her little boy came down to the bars and showed the new clothes that had been made from the wool. \""This pays me for all my trouble,\"" said the Black Sheep, and the little boy reached his hand through the bars and patted her gently upon the head."""
53,Golden Goose,"""There was once a man who had three sons. The youngest of them was called Dullhead, and he was sneered at, jeered at, and snubbed at every possible opportunity. Despite the ridicule he faced, Dullhead remained hopeful and eager to prove himself.\n\nOne day, the eldest son wished to go into the forest to cut wood. Before he started, his mother gave him a fine rich cake and a bottle of wine, ensuring he would not suffer from hunger or thirst. Upon reaching the forest, he encountered a little old grey man who greeted him and asked for a piece of cake and a draught of wine, explaining that he was very hungry and thirsty. However, the clever son refused, saying, \""If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have none left for myself; you just go your own way.\"" He left the little man standing there and continued cutting wood. Unfortunately, he soon made a false stroke with his axe and cut his own arm badly, forcing him to return home for treatment.\n\nThe second son also ventured into the forest, receiving the same provisions from their mother. He too met the little grey man, who begged for a morsel of cake and a draught of wine. The second son, thinking sensibly, replied, \""Whatever I give to you, I deprive myself of. Just go your own way, will you?\"" Shortly after, he struck a couple of blows on a tree with his axe and cut his leg so badly that he had to be carried home.\n\nFinally, Dullhead asked his father for permission to go out and cut wood. His father hesitated, recalling the injuries his other sons had suffered, but Dullhead begged so hard that his father relented, saying, \""Very well, then\u2014go. Perhaps when you have hurt yourself, you may learn to know better.\"" His mother only gave him a plain cake made with water and baked in the cinders, along with a bottle of sour beer.\n\nWhen Dullhead reached the forest, he met the little grey man, who greeted him and asked for a piece of cake and a draught from his bottle. Dullhead replied, \""I've only got a cinder-cake and some sour beer, but if you care to have that, let us sit down and eat.\"" They sat down together, and to Dullhead's surprise, the cinder-cake turned into a fine rich cake, and the sour beer transformed into excellent wine. After they finished eating, the little man said, \""Now I will bring you luck because you have a kind heart and are willing to share what you have with others. There stands an old tree; cut it down, and amongst its roots, you'll find something.\"" With that, the little man took his leave.\n\nDullhead immediately began to cut down the tree, and when it fell, he discovered a goose with feathers of pure gold among its roots. He lifted it out and carried it to an inn where he planned to spend the night. The landlord of the inn had three daughters, and when they saw the goose, they were filled with curiosity about the wonderful bird and each longed to have one of its golden feathers.\n\nThe eldest daughter thought she would find an opportunity to pluck a feather when Dullhead left the room. However, as soon as she touched the goose, her fingers stuck fast, and she could not pull away. Soon after, the second daughter entered with the same intention, but when she touched her sister, she too became stuck. Finally, the third sister came in, and despite the warnings from her sisters, she jumped in to join them, only to find herself stuck as well. Thus, all three sisters had to spend the night with the goose.\n\nThe next morning, Dullhead tucked the goose under his arm and left the inn, completely unconcerned about the three girls who were now attached to it. They had to run after him as best they could. In the middle of a field, they encountered a parson, who, upon seeing the procession, exclaimed, \""For shame, you bold girls! What do you mean by running after a young fellow through the fields like that? Do you call that proper behavior?\"" He grabbed the youngest girl by the hand in an attempt to pull her away, but as soon as he touched her, he became stuck as well.\n\nNot long after, a clerk came by and was surprised to see the parson following the three girls. \""Why, where is your reverence going so fast?\"" he asked, and without waiting for an answer, he grabbed the parson's sleeve and became stuck too. As the five of them trotted along in this manner, two peasants returning from work saw them and were called upon by the parson to help. However, as soon as they touched the clerk, they too became stuck, resulting in seven people running after Dullhead and his goose.\n\nEventually, they arrived in a town ruled by a King whose daughter was so serious and solemn that no one could ever make her laugh. The King had decreed that whoever could make her laugh would marry her. When Dullhead heard this, he marched before the Princess with his goose and its entourage. As soon as she saw the seven people running after each other, she burst out laughing and could not stop herself. Dullhead claimed her as his bride, but the King, not wanting a son-in-law he deemed foolish, set various challenges for him.\n\nThe King first demanded that Dullhead find a man who could drink an entire cellar of wine. Dullhead remembered the little grey man and returned to the forest, where he found the man sitting with a dismal expression. Dullhead asked what troubled him, and the man lamented his terrible thirst. Dullhead offered to help, leading him to the King's cellar, where the man drank until the entire cellar was empty.\n\nOnce again, Dullhead asked for his bride, but the King, still reluctant, required him to find a man who could eat a mountain of bread. Dullhead went back to the forest and found a man who was tightening his belt, complaining of hunger. Dullhead invited him to the King's Court, where the man devoured the entire mountain of bread in a single day.\n\nFor the third time, Dullhead requested his bride, but the King set yet another challenge: he demanded a ship that could sail on land and water. Dullhead returned to the forest and found the little grey man once more. The man, grateful for Dullhead's kindness, provided him with the ship. When the King saw the miraculous vessel, he could no longer refuse Dullhead's request for his daughter.\n\nThus, they celebrated the wedding with great rejoicing, and after the King's death, Dullhead succeeded to the kingdom, living happily with his wife for many years thereafter."""
54,Happy Prince,"""High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince. He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt. He was very much admired indeed. \""He is as beautiful as a weathercock,\"" remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; \""only not quite so useful,\"" he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.\n\n\""Why can't you be like the Happy Prince?\"" asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon. \""The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything.\"" \""I am glad there is someone in the world who is quite happy,\"" muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue. \""He looks just like an angel,\"" said the Charity Children as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white pinafores. \""How do you know?\"" said the Mathematical Master, \""you have never seen one.\"" \""Ah! but we have, in our dreams,\"" answered the children; and the Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of children dreaming.\n\nOne night, a little Swallow flew over the city. His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her. \""Shall I love you?\"" said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow. So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings and making silver ripples. This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.\n\n\""It is a ridiculous attachment,\"" twittered the other Swallows; \""she has no money, and far too many relations\""; and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds. Then, when the autumn came, they all flew away. After they had gone, he felt lonely and began to tire of his lady-love. \""She has no conversation,\"" he said, \""and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.\"" And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys. \""I admit that she is domestic,\"" he continued, \""but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.\"" \""Will you come away with me?\"" he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her head; she was so attached to her home. \""You have been trifling with me,\"" he cried. \""I am off to the Pyramids. Good-bye!\"" and he flew away.\n\nAll day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city. \""Where shall I put up?\"" he said; \""I hope the town has made preparations.\"" Then he saw the statue on the tall column. \""I will put up there,\"" he cried; \""it is a fine position, with plenty of fresh air.\"" So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince. \""I have a golden bedroom,\"" he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing, a large drop of water fell on him. \""What a curious thing!\"" he cried; \""there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining. The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful. The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.\""\n\nThen another drop fell. \""What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?\"" he said; \""I must look for a good chimney-pot,\"" and he determined to fly away. But before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw\u2014Ah! what did he see? The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks. His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity. \""Who are you?\"" he said. \""I am the Happy Prince.\"" \""Why are you weeping then?\"" asked the Swallow; \""you have quite drenched me.\""\n\n\""When I was alive and had a human heart,\"" answered the statue, \""I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter. In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall. Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it; everything about me was so beautiful. My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness. So I lived, and so I died. And now that I am dead, they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead, yet I cannot choose but weep.\""\n\n\""What! is he not solid gold?\"" said the Swallow to himself. He was too polite to make any personal remarks out loud. \""Far away,\"" continued the statue in a low musical voice, \""far away in a little street there is a poor house. One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress. She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen's maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court-ball. In a bed in the corner of the room, her little boy is lying ill. He has a fever and is asking for oranges. His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? My feet are fastened to this pedestal, and I cannot move.\""\n\n\""I am waited for in Egypt,\"" said the Swallow. \""My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers. Soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King. The King is there himself in his painted coffin. He is wrapped in yellow linen and embalmed with spices. Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.\"" \""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\"" said the Prince, \""will you not stay with me for one night, and be my messenger? The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so sad.\""\n\n\""I don't think I like boys,\"" answered the Swallow. \""Last summer, when I was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller's sons, who were always throwing stones at me. They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.\"" But the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry. \""It is very cold here,\"" he said; \""but I will stay with you for one night, and be your messenger.\"" \""Thank you, little Swallow,\"" said the Prince.\n\nSo the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince's sword and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town. He passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured. He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing. A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover. \""How wonderful the stars are,\"" he said to her, \""and how wonderful is the power of love!\"" \""I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,\"" she answered; \""I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the seamstresses are so lazy.\""\n\nHe passed over the river and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of the ships. He passed over the Ghetto and saw the old Jews bargaining with each other and weighing out money in copper scales. At last he came to the poor house and looked in. The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep; she was so tired. In he hopped and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman's thimble. Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy's forehead with his wings. \""How cool I feel,\"" said the boy, \""I must be getting better\""; and he sank into a delicious slumber.\n\nThen the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince and told him what he had done. \""It is curious,\"" he remarked, \""but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.\"" \""That is because you have done a good action,\"" said the Prince. And the little Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep. Thinking always made him sleepy.\n\nWhen day broke, he flew down to the river and had a bath. \""What a remarkable phenomenon,\"" said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge. \""A swallow in winter!\"" And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper. Everyone quoted it; it was full of so many words that they could not understand. \""To-night I go to Egypt,\"" said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the prospect. He visited all the public monuments and sat a long time on top of the church steeple. Wherever he went, the Sparrows chirruped and said to each other, \""What a distinguished stranger!\"" so he enjoyed himself very much.\n\nWhen the moon rose, he flew back to the Happy Prince. \""Have you any commissions for Egypt?\"" he cried; \""I am just starting.\"" \""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\"" said the Prince, \""will you not stay with me one night longer?\"" \""I am waited for in Egypt,\"" answered the Swallow. \""To-morrow my friends will fly up to the Second Cataract. The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon. All night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines, he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent. At noon the yellow lions come down to the water's edge to drink. They have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.\""\n\n\""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\"" said the Prince, \""far away across the city I see a young man in a garret. He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets. His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes. He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any more. There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.\"" \""I will wait with you one night longer,\"" said the Swallow, who really had a good heart. \""Shall I take him another ruby?\""\n\n\""Alas! I have no ruby now,\"" said the Prince; \""my eyes are all that I have left. They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago. Pluck out one of them and take it to him. He will sell it to the jeweller and buy food and firewood, and finish his play.\"" \""Dear Prince,\"" said the Swallow, \""I cannot do that\""; and he began to weep. \""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\"" said the Prince, \""do as I command you.\"" So the Swallow plucked out the Prince's eye and flew away to the student's garret. It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof. Through this he darted and came into the room. The young man had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the bird's wings, and when he looked up, he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets.\n\n\""I am beginning to be appreciated,\"" he cried; \""this is from some great admirer. Now I can finish my play,\"" and he looked quite happy. The next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour. He sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes. \""Heave a-hoy!\"" they shouted as each chest came up. \""I am going to Egypt!\"" cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose, he flew back to the Happy Prince. \""I am come to bid you good-bye,\"" he cried.\n\n\""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\"" said the Prince, \""will you not stay with me one night longer?\"" \""It is winter,\"" answered the Swallow, \""and the chill snow will soon be here. In Egypt, the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them. My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them and cooing to each other. Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.\""\n\n\""In the square below,\"" said the Happy Prince, \""there stands a little match-girl. She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled. Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying. She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare. Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will not beat her.\"" \""I will stay with you one night longer,\"" said the Swallow, \""but I cannot pluck out your eye. You would be quite blind then.\"" \""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\"" said the Prince, \""do as I command you.\"" \n\nSo he plucked out the Prince's other eye and darted down with it. He swooped past the match-girl and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand. \""What a lovely bit of glass,\"" cried the little girl; and she ran home, laughing. Then the Swallow came back to the Prince. \""You are blind now,\"" he said, \""so I will stay with you always.\"" \""No, little Swallow,\"" said the poor Prince, \""you must go away to Egypt.\"" \""I will stay with you always,\"" said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet.\n\nAll the next day he sat on the Prince's shoulder and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands. He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself and lives in the desert and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony and worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves and are always at war with the butterflies.\n\n\""Dear little Swallow,\"" said the Prince, \""you tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women. There is no Mystery so great as Misery. Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there.\"" So the Swallow flew over the great city and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates. He flew into dark lanes and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets. Under the archway of a bridge, two little boys were lying in one another's arms to try and keep themselves warm. \""How hungry we are!\"" they said. \""You must not lie here,\"" shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.\n\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen. \""I am covered with fine gold,\"" said the Prince, \""you must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold can make them happy.\"" Leaf after leaf of the fine gold, the Swallow picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey. Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the children's faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street. \""We have bread now!\"" they cried.\n\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the frost. The streets looked as if they were made of silver; they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice. The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince; he loved him too well. He picked up crumbs outside the baker's door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.\n\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to fly up to the Prince's shoulder once more. \""Good-bye, dear Prince!\"" he murmured, \""will you let me kiss your hand?\"" \""I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,\"" said the Prince, \""you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you.\"" \""It is not to Egypt that I am going,\"" said the Swallow. \""I am going to the House of Death. Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?\"" And he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips and fell down dead at his feet.\n\nAt that moment, a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken. The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two. It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost. Early the next morning, the Mayor was walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors. As they passed the column, he looked up at the statue: \""Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!\"" he said. \""How shabby indeed!\"" cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with the Mayor; and they went up to look at it.\n\n\""The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer,\"" said the Mayor in fact, \""he is little better than a beggar!\"" \""Little better than a beggar,\"" said the Town Councillors. \""And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!\"" continued the Mayor. \""We must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die here.\"" And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion. So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. \""As he is no longer beautiful, he is no longer useful,\"" said the Art Professor at the University. Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal. \""We must have another statue, of course,\"" he said, \""and it shall be a statue of myself.\"" \""Of myself,\"" said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled. When I last heard of them, they were quarrelling still.\n\n\""What a strange thing!\"" said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry. \""This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace. We must throw it away.\"" So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also lying. \""Bring me the two most precious things in the city,\"" said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird. \""You have rightly chosen,\"" said God, \""for in my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold, the Happy Prince shall praise me.\"""""
55,Little Boy Blue,"""There once lived a poor widow who supported herself and her only son by gleaning in the fields the stalks of grain that had been missed by the reapers. Her little cottage was at the foot of a beautiful valley, upon the edge of the river that wound in and out among the green hills. Although poor, she was contented with her lot, for her home was pleasant and her lovely boy was a constant delight to her. He had big blue eyes and fair golden curls, and he loved his good mother very dearly, never more pleased than when she allowed him to help her with her work.\n\nAs the years passed happily, the boy grew to be eight years old, but then the widow fell sick, and their little store of money melted gradually away. \""I don't know what we shall do for bread,\"" she said, kissing her boy with tears in her eyes, \""for I am not yet strong enough to work, and we have no money left.\"" The boy, eager to help, replied, \""But I can work, and I'm sure if I go to the Squire up at the Hall he will give me something to do.\"" Initially reluctant to let him go, the widow finally consented, realizing there was no other option.\n\nDetermined to send her son in proper attire, she made him a new suit from a pretty blue dress she had worn in happier times. When the boy was dressed, he looked as pretty as a prince in a fairy tale, with the bright blue jacket accentuating his curls and matching the color of his eyes. She adorned his trousers with silver buckles from her own shoes and sent him off with a kiss to see the Squire.\n\nThat morning, the Squire was walking in his garden with his daughter Madge, feeling especially happy. When he saw the little boy before him, he kindly asked, \""Well, my child, what can I do for you?\"" The boy bravely replied, \""If you please, sir, I want you to give me some work to do, so that I can earn money.\"" The Squire inquired why he wanted to earn money, and the boy explained, \""To buy food for my mother, sir. We are very poor, and since she is no longer able to work for me, I wish to work for her.\""\n\nTouched by the boy's earnestness, Madge stepped forward, took his hand, and kissed his fair cheek. \""You shall be our shepherd,\"" she said, \""and keep the sheep out of the meadows and the cows from getting into the corn.\"" The Squire agreed, saying, \""If he is attentive and watchful, he will be able to save me a good bit of trouble and earn his money.\"" He then asked the boy his name, but Madge interrupted, saying, \""I shall call him Little Boy Blue, since he is dressed in blue from head to foot.\"" The Squire cheerfully promised to pay him well.\n\nLittle Boy Blue thanked them both sweetly and ran back over the hill to share the good news with his mother. The poor widow wept tears of joy upon hearing his story and smiled at the name Little Boy Blue, knowing the Squire was a kind master who would care for her son.\n\nEarly the next morning, Little Boy Blue arrived at the Hall, where the Squire's steward gave him a new silver horn and a golden cord to wear around his neck. He was entrusted with the care of the sheep and cows, tasked with keeping them from straying into the meadowlands and fields of grain. The work suited his age perfectly, and he proved to be a diligent shepherd. His mother no longer needed to worry about food, as the Squire paid him generously, and Madge took a liking to him, enjoying the sound of his silver horn echoing through the hills.\n\nAs time passed, Little Boy Blue grew happier, and his mother began to regain her health. She could walk a little each day, meeting him at the stile as he returned from work. However, one day, misfortune struck. Little Boy Blue came homeward, whistling merrily, expecting to find his mother waiting for him. To his dismay, she was not in sight, and a low moan of pain reached his ears.\n\nHe found his dear mother lying on the ground, her face pale and drawn with suffering. She had slipped on the stile and broken her leg. Little Boy Blue rushed to the cottage for water, bathing her face and helping her crawl back to their home. Once she was safely in bed, he anxiously asked if he could leave her alone to fetch the doctor. She urged him to take the boat and get help from the village.\n\nLittle Boy Blue hurried to the riverbank, unfastened the little boat, and rowed to the village. After finding the doctor and explaining his mother's situation, they quickly made their way back to the cottage. The doctor set and bandaged her leg, assuring them it was not a bad break and that she would heal in time. He advised Little Boy Blue to take good care of her, as she would need nursing during her recovery.\n\nThroughout the night, Little Boy Blue sat by his mother's bedside, tending to her needs. When morning came, she insisted he go to work, as they needed the money more than ever. Reluctantly, he left her with food and water by her side and set off to tend his sheep. The sun shone brightly, and the birds sang sweetly, but Little Boy Blue was tired from his long night of watching over his mother.\n\nDespite his fatigue, he worked diligently for several hours, but eventually, he succumbed to sleep while leaning against a haystack. The sheep and cows wandered near the edge of the meadow, waiting for the sound of his horn, but it remained silent. The Squire, returning from a ride, discovered the cows trampling his cornfield and grew angry. He called for Little Boy Blue, but received no response.\n\nThe Squire's daughter, hearing her father's voice, came out to see what was wrong. When she learned that Little Boy Blue had fallen asleep on duty, she felt deeply saddened. The Squire dismounted and shook the boy awake, expressing his disappointment. Little Boy Blue, realizing he had failed in his duty, began to weep, feeling he had let down the Squire.\n\nMoved by his tears, Madge comforted him and asked why he had slept. He explained about his mother's broken leg and how he had stayed up all night caring for her. The Squire, now sympathetic, asked where they lived. Little Boy Blue led them to the cottage, where the Squire spoke with the widow. That day, a basket of food was sent to their home, and Madge arranged for a maid to care for the widow until she recovered.\n\nIn the end, Little Boy Blue's misfortune turned into a blessing. After his mother healed, the Squire provided them with a lovely cottage near the Hall, and Madge remained a good friend, ensuring they lacked for nothing. Little Boy Blue continued to tend the sheep and cows faithfully, growing up to have a farm of his own. He often remarked that his mother's accident had brought him good luck, but it was truly his loving heart and devotion to her that earned him the trust and friendship of others. For no one is afraid to trust a boy who loves to serve and care for his mother."""
62,Snowflake,"""Once upon a time, there lived a peasant named Ivan and his wife, Marie. They would have been quite happy except for one thing: they had no children to play with. As they were now old, watching the children of their neighbors did not make up for their longing for a child of their own.\n\nOne unforgettable winter, the snow lay so deep that it came up to the knees of even the tallest man. After the snow had fallen and the sun was shining again, the children ran out into the street to play. Ivan and Marie sat at their window, gazing at the joyful scene. The children first made a little terrace, stamping it hard and firm, and then began to create a snow woman. Ivan and Marie watched them, lost in their thoughts.\n\nSuddenly, Ivan's face brightened. Looking at his wife, he said, \""Wife, why shouldn't we make a snow woman too?\"" \n\n\""Why not?\"" replied Marie, who happened to be in a good mood. \""It might amuse us a little. But instead of a woman, let us make a little snow child and pretend it is a living one.\""\n\n\""Yes, let us do that,\"" said Ivan, and he took down his cap, leading his old wife into the garden.\n\nThe two set to work with all their might to create a doll out of the snow. They shaped a little body, two little hands, and two little feet. On top, they placed a ball of snow for the head. \n\n\""What in the world are you doing?\"" asked a passer-by.\n\n\""Can't you guess?\"" returned Ivan.\n\n\""Making a snow-child,\"" replied Marie.\n\nThey finished the nose and chin, leaving two holes for the eyes. As Ivan carefully shaped the mouth, he felt a warm breath upon his cheek. Startled, he looked and beheld the eyes of the child meeting his, and its lips, as red as raspberries, smiled at him.\n\n\""What is it?\"" cried Ivan, crossing himself. \""Am I mad, or is the thing bewitched?\""\n\nThe snow-child bent its head as if it were truly alive, moving its little arms and legs in the snow just like the living children did. \n\n\""Ah! Ivan, Ivan,\"" exclaimed Marie, trembling with joy. \""Heaven has sent us a child at last!\"" She threw herself upon Snowflake (for that was the snow-child's name) and covered her with kisses. As the loose snow fell away from Snowflake, it revealed a little girl whom Marie held in her arms.\n\n\""Oh! my darling Snowflake!\"" cried the old woman, leading her into the cottage. \n\nSnowflake grew quickly; each hour and day made a difference, and she became more beautiful. The old couple could hardly contain their joy, thinking of nothing else. Their cottage was always full of village children who came to amuse Snowflake. They treated her like a doll, inventing new dresses for her, teaching her songs, and playing with her. No one knew how clever she was; she noticed everything and could learn a lesson in a moment. Anyone would have taken her for thirteen at least! She was good, obedient, and incredibly pretty, with skin as white as snow, eyes as blue as forget-me-nots, and long golden hair. Only her cheeks lacked color, as fair as her forehead.\n\nAs winter passed, spring arrived, bringing warmth and life. The grass grew green, and larks sang in the air. The village girls danced in a ring, singing, \""Beautiful spring, how came you here? Did you come on a plough, or was it a harrow?\"" But Snowflake sat quietly by the window of the cottage.\n\n\""What is the matter, dear child?\"" asked Marie. \""Why are you so sad? Are you ill, or have they treated you unkindly?\""\n\n\""No,\"" replied Snowflake. \""It is nothing, mother; no one has hurt me; I am well.\""\n\nThe spring sun chased away the last snow, filling the fields with flowers and the trees with nightingales. Yet, as the world grew gayer, Snowflake became sadder. She hid from her playmates, curling up in the deepest shadows, like a lily among its leaves. Her only pleasure was lying by a sparkling stream, finding joy only at dawn and twilight. When a storm broke, and the earth was white with hail, she brightened like the Snowflake of old, but when the clouds passed and the hail melted, she wept as a sister would weep over her brother.\n\nThe spring passed, and it was the eve of St. John, or Midsummer Day, the greatest holiday of the year. The young girls met in the woods to dance and play. They came to fetch Snowflake and asked Marie, \""Let her come and dance with us.\""\n\nMarie hesitated, feeling an inexplicable fear. Snowflake did not wish to go either, but they had no excuse ready. So Marie kissed her and said, \""Go, my Snowflake, and be happy with your friends. You, dear children, be careful of her. You know she is the light of my eyes.\""\n\n\""Oh, we will take care of her,\"" cried the girls gaily, and they ran off to the woods. There, they wore wreaths, gathered nosegays, and sang songs, some sad, some merry. Whatever they did, Snowflake did too.\n\nAs the sun set, they lit a fire of dry grass and lined up, with Snowflake at the end. \""Now, watch us,\"" they said, \""and run just as we do.\"" They began to sing and jump one after another across the fire.\n\nSuddenly, they heard a sigh, then a groan. \""Ah!\"" They turned hastily and looked at each other. There was nothing. They searched for Snowflake everywhere, calling her name, but there was no answer. \""Where can she be? Oh, she must have gone home.\"" They returned to the village, but Snowflake was nowhere to be found.\n\nFor days, they searched high and low, examining every bush and hedge, but Snowflake was gone. Long after everyone else had given up hope, Ivan and Marie wandered through the woods, crying, \""Snowflake, my dove, come back, come back!\"" Sometimes they thought they heard a call, but it was never Snowflake's voice.\n\nWhat had become of her? Had a fierce wild beast seized her and dragged her into its lair in the forest? Had some bird carried her off across the wide blue sea?\n\nNo, no beast had touched her, no bird had borne her away. With the first breath of flame that swept over her when she ran with her friends, Snowflake had melted away, leaving only a little soft haze floating upwards as a reminder of her existence."""
63,Tale Of Ginger And Pickles,"""Once upon a time, there was a village shop named \""Ginger and Pickles.\"" It was a little small shop, just the right size for dolls. Lucinda and Jane Doll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles. The counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits, and the shop sold red spotty pocket-handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings. In fact, although it was such a small shop, it sold nearly everything\u2014except a few things that you want in a hurry, like bootlaces, hair-pins, and mutton chops.\n\nGinger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop. Ginger was a yellow tom-cat, and Pickles was a terrier. The rabbits were always a little bit afraid of Pickles, while the mice were rather afraid of Ginger. To avoid any trouble, Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve the mice, as he said it made his mouth water to see them leaving with their little parcels. Pickles, on the other hand, expressed a similar feeling about rats, but he knew it would never do to eat their own customers, as they would leave and go to Tabitha Twitchit's shop, the only other shop in the village that did not give credit.\n\nGinger and Pickles offered unlimited credit, which meant that when a customer bought something, they could promise to pay another time instead of paying immediately. Pickles would make a low bow and say, \""With pleasure, madam,\"" while writing it down in a book. Despite being afraid of Ginger and Pickles, customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities of goods, especially toffee. However, there was never any money in the till; they never paid for as much as a pennyworth of peppermints. The sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit's, but without any money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat their own goods. They dined by candlelight after the shop was closed, with Pickles eating biscuits and Ginger enjoying a dried haddock.\n\nAs January 1st approached, there was still no money, and Pickles was unable to buy a dog license. He expressed his fear of the police, while Ginger pointed out that he did not require a license, nor did Kep, the Collie dog. Pickles was anxious about being summoned, especially after encountering a policeman on his way home. Ginger suggested sending in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, who owed 22 shillings and 9 pence for bacon, but Ginger was skeptical about whether he would pay. They also suspected that Anna Maria was pocketing things, as they could not find the cream crackers.\n\nAfter a time spent doing accounts, they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been pushed in at the door. When they came out of the back parlour, they found an envelope lying on the counter and a policeman writing in a notebook. Pickles nearly had a fit, barking and making little rushes, while Ginger urged him to bite the policeman, who he believed was just a German doll. However, the policeman continued writing, seemingly unfazed by Pickles' antics. Eventually, Pickles discovered that the shop was empty, and the policeman had disappeared, leaving behind the envelope.\n\nGinger opened the envelope and revealed that it contained the rates and taxes bill, amounting to 3 pounds, 19 shillings, and 11 pence 3 farthings. This was the last straw for Pickles, who suggested they close the shop. They put up the shutters and left, but they did not move far from the neighborhood. In fact, some villagers wished they had gone further. Ginger took up residence in the warren, looking stout and comfortable, while Pickles became a gamekeeper.\n\nThe closing of the shop caused great inconvenience in the village. Tabitha Twitchit immediately raised the price of everything by half a penny and continued to refuse credit. Although there were tradesmen's carts, such as the butcher, the fish-man, and Timothy Baker, villagers found it difficult to live on \""seed wigs\"" and sponge-cake, even if Timothy's sponge-cake was excellent. Eventually, Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began selling peppermints and candles, but they did not keep \""self-fitting sixes,\"" and it took five mice to carry one seven-inch candle. Moreover, the candles behaved strangely in warm weather, and Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when customers complained.\n\nWhen Mr. John Dormouse was approached with complaints, he would stay in bed and only say, \""very snug,\"" which was not a good way to run a retail business. Therefore, everyone was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster announcing her intention to re-open the shop with a \""Henny's Opening Sale! Grand co-operative Jumble! Penny's penny prices! Come buy, come try, come buy!\"" The poster was quite enticing, and on the opening day, the shop was crammed with customers, with crowds of mice upon the biscuit canisters.\n\nSally Henny Penny, though a bit flustered when counting out change, insisted on being paid in cash and was quite harmless. She had laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains, ensuring there was something to please everybody in the village once again."""
64,Tale Of Johnny Town Mouse,"""Johnny Town-mouse was born in a cupboard, while Timmy Willie was born in a garden. Timmy Willie, a little country mouse, found himself in town by mistake when he crept into a hamper filled with vegetables. The gardener sent these vegetables to town once a week, packing them in a big wicker hamper that he left by the garden gate for the carrier to pick up.\n\nOne day, Timmy Willie snuck into the hamper through a small hole and, after munching on some peas, fell fast asleep. He was jolted awake in a fright as the hamper was lifted into the carrier's cart. The ride was bumpy, with the sound of clattering horse's feet and other packages being thrown in. For miles, Timmy Willie trembled among the jumbled vegetables, feeling increasingly anxious.\n\nEventually, the cart stopped at a house, where the hamper was taken inside. The cook paid the carrier, and the back door banged shut, leaving Timmy Willie surrounded by a cacophony of noise. There were carts passing by, dogs barking, boys whistling, and the cook laughing, all of which terrified Timmy Willie, who had lived a quiet life in the garden. When the cook opened the hamper to unpack the vegetables, Timmy Willie sprang out in a panic.\n\nThe cook screamed and jumped onto a chair, calling for the cat and demanding a poker from Sarah. Not waiting for Sarah, Timmy Willie dashed along the skirting board until he found a small hole and squeezed through. He dropped into the middle of a mouse dinner party, crashing into the table and breaking three glasses. \""Who in the world is this?\"" inquired Johnny Town-mouse, but he quickly regained his composure and introduced Timmy Willie to the other mice, all of whom wore white neckties.\n\nThe dinner was extravagant, consisting of eight courses, but Timmy Willie was unfamiliar with the dishes. Despite his hunger, he felt nervous and clumsy, dropping a plate in the process. Johnny reassured him that it didn\u2019t matter since the dishes didn\u2019t belong to them. The noise from upstairs made Timmy Willie increasingly anxious, especially when he learned that two young mice were being chased by the cat. His appetite vanished, and he felt faint.\n\nJohnny Town-mouse offered him jelly, but Timmy declined, preferring to go to bed. Johnny suggested a comfortable sofa pillow, but it smelled of cat, so Timmy opted to spend a miserable night under the fender instead. The next day was no better; breakfast was provided, but it was not to Timmy's taste. While Johnny and his friends scurried about the house, Timmy longed for the peace of his garden home.\n\nAs days passed, Timmy Willie grew thinner, prompting Johnny to inquire about his well-being. Timmy shared stories of his garden, filled with flowers and the sounds of nature, contrasting sharply with the chaos of the town. Johnny, feeling a bit disappointed, suggested that perhaps Timmy should return home in the hamper, which was scheduled to go back empty on Saturdays.\n\nTimmy Willie eagerly agreed, saying goodbye to his new friends and hiding in the hamper with a crumb of cake and a withered cabbage leaf. After a bumpy ride, he was safely returned to his garden. Although he occasionally looked at the hamper by the gate, he knew better than to climb in again, and no one else ventured out, despite Johnny's half-hearted promise to visit.\n\nAs winter passed and spring arrived, Timmy Willie basked in the sun, nearly forgetting his town adventure. One day, he spotted Johnny Town-mouse approaching with a brown leather bag. Timmy welcomed him warmly, offering herb pudding and a sunny spot to sit. However, Johnny was cautious about the dampness and startled at the sounds around him.\n\nTimmy reassured him that the noise was just a cow, harmless unless it lay down on you. Johnny shared that his family had gone to the seaside for Easter, leaving him to fend for himself amidst spring cleaning and a cat that had killed the canary. Despite the chaos, Timmy offered to fetch grass clippings for Johnny's bed, suggesting he might prefer the country life.\n\nJohnny, however, was noncommittal, stating that he would return to town when the hamper resumed its trips. Timmy insisted that Johnny would never want to live in town again, but to his surprise, Johnny did return in the very next hamper of vegetables, claiming it was too quiet in the country.\n\nIn the end, the story illustrates that one place suits one person while another place suits another. For Timmy Willie, the peaceful life in the country was preferable, while Johnny Town-mouse thrived in the bustling town."""
65,Tale Of Mrs.tittlemouse,"""Once upon a time, there was a wood-mouse named Mrs. Tittlemouse. She lived in a bank under a hedge, in a most peculiar house. There were yards and yards of sandy passages leading to storerooms, nut-cellars, and seed-cellars, all nestled amongst the roots of the hedge. Her home included a kitchen, a parlour, a pantry, and a larder, as well as Mrs. Tittlemouse's cozy bedroom, where she slept in a little box bed.\n\nMrs. Tittlemouse was a terribly tidy and particular little mouse, always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors. Occasionally, a beetle would lose its way in the passages, prompting her to scold, \""Shuh! shuh! little dirty feet!\"" while clattering her dust-pan. One day, a little old woman in a red spotty cloak ran by, and Mrs. Tittlemouse exclaimed, \""Your house is on fire, Mother Ladybird! Fly away home to your children!\"" \n\nAnother day, a big fat spider sought shelter from the rain. \""Beg pardon, is this not Miss Muffet's?\"" he asked. Mrs. Tittlemouse firmly replied, \""Go away, you bold bad spider! You're leaving ends of cobweb all over my nice clean house!\"" She promptly bundled the spider out of the window, where he let himself down the hedge with a long thin bit of string.\n\nContinuing on her way to a distant storeroom to fetch cherry-stones and thistle-down seed for dinner, Mrs. Tittlemouse sniffed the air and noticed a peculiar smell. \""I smell a smell of honey; is it the cowslips outside, in the hedge? I am sure I can see the marks of little dirty feet.\"" Suddenly, she rounded a corner and encountered Babbitty Bumble, the bumblebee, who buzzed, \""Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!\"" \n\nMrs. Tittlemouse looked at her severely, wishing she had a broom. \""Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I should be glad to buy some beeswax. But what are you doing down here? Why do you always come in at a window and say Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz?\"" she asked, growing cross. Babbitty Bumble replied with a peevish squeak, \""Zizz, Wizz, Wizzz!\"" and sidled down a passage, disappearing into a storeroom that had once held acorns.\n\nTo Mrs. Tittlemouse's dismay, the storeroom was not empty; it was filled with untidy dry moss. As she began to pull out the moss, several other bees poked their heads out and buzzed fiercely. \""I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion!\"" she declared. \""I will have them turned out\u2014\"" but the buzzing continued. \""I wonder who would help me?\"" she pondered, dismissing the idea of Mr. Jackson, who never wiped his feet.\n\nDeciding to leave the bees for later, Mrs. Tittlemouse returned to the parlour, only to find Mr. Jackson himself sitting in a small rocking-chair, twiddling his thumbs and smiling, with his feet on the fender. \""How do you do, Mr. Jackson? Deary me, you have got very wet!\"" she remarked, noticing the water dripping off his coat tails. \n\n\""Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! I'll sit awhile and dry myself,\"" he replied. After a while, she asked if he would like some dinner. She first offered him cherry-stones, to which he responded, \""No teeth, no teeth, no teeth!\"" opening his mouth wide to show he had no teeth at all. Next, she offered him thistle-down seed, but he blew it all over the room, exclaiming, \""Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Pouff, pouff, puff!\"" \n\nMr. Jackson then insisted he could smell honey. \""I am afraid I have not got any, Mr. Jackson,\"" Mrs. Tittlemouse replied. However, he rose ponderously from the table and began to search through her cupboards. Mrs. Tittlemouse followed him with a dish-cloth, trying to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlour floor. \n\nAs he squeezed into the pantry and larder, he encountered various creatures, including a little creepy-crawly that he caught. \""You seem to have plenty of visitors!\"" he remarked, while Mrs. Tittlemouse scolded, \""And without any invitation!\"" When he met Babbitty Bumble again, he snapped her up but quickly put her down, declaring, \""I do not like bumble bees. They are all over bristles.\""\n\nFrustrated, Mrs. Tittlemouse shut herself up in the nut-cellar while Mr. Jackson pulled out the bees' nest, seemingly unfazed by the stings. When she finally ventured out, she was horrified to find her home in utter disarray\u2014smears of honey, moss, thistledown, and marks of big and little dirty feet all over her once clean house. \n\nDetermined to restore order, she gathered up the mess and fetched twigs to partially close up the front door, thinking, \""I will make it too small for Mr. Jackson!\"" She then retrieved soft soap, flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from the storeroom. However, exhaustion overcame her, and she fell asleep in her chair before heading to bed, wondering, \""Will it ever be tidy again?\""\n\nThe next morning, Mrs. Tittlemouse rose early and embarked on a spring cleaning that lasted a fortnight. She swept, scrubbed, and dusted, polishing her little tin spoons and rubbing up the furniture with beeswax. When her home was finally beautifully neat and clean, she decided to host a party for five other little mice, deliberately excluding Mr. Jackson.\n\nMr. Jackson, smelling the festivities, came up the bank but found he could not squeeze in at the door. Undeterred, the little mice handed him out acorn-cupfuls of honey-dew through the window, and he was not at all offended. Sitting outside in the sun, he raised a toast, saying, \""Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Your very good health, Mrs. Tittlemouse!\"""""
66,Tale Of Tom Kitten,"""Once upon a time, there were three little kittens, and their names were Mittens, Tom Kitten, and Moppet. They had dear little fur coats of their own and tumbled about the doorstep, playing in the dust. However, one day their mother, Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, expected friends to tea, so she fetched the kittens indoors to wash and dress them before the fine company arrived.\n\nFirst, she scrubbed their faces, starting with Moppet. Then she brushed their fur, focusing on Mittens. Finally, she combed their tails and whiskers, which belonged to Tom Kitten. Tom was very naughty and scratched during the grooming process. Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers, and then she took out all sorts of elegant but uncomfortable clothes from a chest of drawers to dress up her son, Thomas. Tom Kitten was quite fat and had grown, causing several buttons to burst off. His mother sewed them back on again.\n\nWhen the three kittens were finally ready, Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden to keep them out of the way while she made hot buttered toast. \""Now keep your frocks clean, children! You must walk on your hind legs. Keep away from the dirty ash-pit, and from Sally Henny Penny, and from the pig-stye and the Puddle-Ducks,\"" she instructed. Moppet and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily, but soon they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses, leaving several green smears on their faces.\n\n\""Let us climb up the rockery and sit on the garden wall,\"" suggested Moppet. They turned their pinafores back to front and went up with a skip and a jump, but Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road. Tom Kitten, however, was quite unable to jump while walking on his hind legs in trousers. He climbed the rockery slowly, breaking ferns and shedding buttons along the way. By the time he reached the top of the wall, he was all in pieces.\n\nMoppet and Mittens tried to pull him together, but his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst. While they were in this predicament, they heard a pit pat paddle pat! as the three Puddle-Ducks marched along the hard high road, one behind the other, doing the goose step. They stopped in a row and stared up at the kittens with their very small eyes, looking surprised. The two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-Duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.\n\nMittens laughed so hard that she fell off the wall, prompting Moppet and Tom to descend after her. Unfortunately, the pinafores and all of Tom's clothes came off on the way down. \""Come, Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck,\"" said Moppet, \""Come and help us to dress him! Come and button up Tom!\"" Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck advanced in a slow sideways manner and picked up the various articles, but he ended up putting them on himself! They fit him even worse than they did Tom Kitten.\n\n\""It's a very fine morning!\"" said Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck, and he, along with Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-Duck, set off up the road, keeping step with their pit pat, paddle pat! As this was happening, Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on. She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.\n\n\""My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted,\"" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit. She sent them upstairs and, regrettably, told her friends that they were in bed with the measles, which was not true. Quite the contrary; they were not in bed at all. However, there were very extraordinary noises overhead that disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party.\n\nAnd I think that someday I shall have to make another, larger book to tell you more about Tom Kitten! As for the Puddle-Ducks, they went into a pond. The clothes all came off immediately because there were no buttons, and Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck, along with Jemima and Rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since."""
67,The Fir Tree,"""There was once a pretty little fir-tree in a wood. It was in a capital position, for it could get sun, and there was enough air, and all around grew many tall companions, both pines and firs. It did not heed the warm sun and the fresh air, or notice the little peasant children who ran about chattering when they came out to gather wild strawberries and raspberries. Often they found a whole basketful and strung strawberries on a straw; they would sit down by the little fir-tree and say, \""What a pretty little one this is!\"" The tree did not like that at all.\n\nBy the next year, it had grown a whole ring taller, and the year after that another ring more, for you can always tell a fir-tree's age from its rings. \""Oh! if I were only a great tree like the others!\"" sighed the little fir-tree, \""then I could stretch out my branches far and wide and look out into the great world! The birds would build their nests in my branches, and when the wind blew I would bow to it politely just like the others!\"" It took no pleasure in the sunshine, nor in the birds, nor in the rose-colored clouds that sailed over it at dawn and at sunset. Then the winter came, and the snow lay white and sparkling all around, and a hare would come and spring right over the little fir-tree, which annoyed it very much. But when two more winters had passed, the fir-tree was so tall that the hare had to run round it. \""Ah! to grow and grow, and become great and old! That is the only pleasure in life,\"" thought the tree.\n\nIn the autumn, the woodcutters used to come and hew some of the tallest trees; this happened every year, and the young fir-tree would shiver as the magnificent trees fell crashing and crackling to the ground, their branches hewn off, and the great trunks left bare, so that they were almost unrecognizable. But then they were laid on waggons and dragged out of the wood by horses. \""Where are they going? What will happen to them?\"" In spring, when the swallows and storks came, the fir-tree asked them, \""Do you know where they were taken? Have you met them?\"" The swallows knew nothing of them, but the stork nodded his head thoughtfully, saying, \""I think I know. I met many new ships as I flew from Egypt; there were splendid masts on the ships. I'll wager those were they! They had the scent of fir-trees. Ah! those are grand, grand!\""\n\n\""Oh! if I were only big enough to sail away over the sea too! What sort of thing is the sea? What does it look like?\"" \""Oh! it would take much too long to tell you all that,\"" said the stork, and off he went. \""Rejoice in your youth,\"" said the sunbeams, \""rejoice in the sweet growing time, in the young life within you.\"" And the wind kissed it, and the dew wept tears over it, but the fir-tree did not understand.\n\nTowards Christmas-time, quite little trees were cut down, some not as big as the young fir-tree, or just the same age, and now it had no peace or rest for longing to be away. These little trees, which were chosen for their beauty, kept all their branches; they were put in carts and drawn out of the wood by horses. \""Whither are those going?\"" asked the fir-tree; \""they are no bigger than I, and one there was much smaller even! Why do they keep their branches? Where are they taken to?\"" \""We know! we know!\"" twittered the sparrows. \""Down there in the city we have peeped in at the windows, we know where they go! They attain to the greatest splendour and magnificence you can imagine! We have looked in at the windows and seen them planted in the middle of the warm room and adorned with the most beautiful things\u2014golden apples, sweet-meats, toys, and hundreds of candles.\""\n\n\""And then?\"" asked the fir-tree, trembling in every limb with eagerness, \""and then? What happens then?\"" \""Oh, we haven't seen anything more than that. That was simply matchless!\"" \""Am I too destined to the same brilliant career?\"" wondered the fir-tree excitedly. \""That is even better than sailing over the sea! I am sick with longing. If it were only Christmas! Now I am tall and grown-up like those which were taken away last year. Ah, if I were only in the cart! If I were only in the warm room with all the splendour and magnificence! And then? Then comes something better, something still more beautiful, else why should they dress us up? There must be something greater, something grander to come\u2014but what? Oh! I am pining away! I really don't know what's the matter with me!\""\n\n\""Rejoice in us,\"" said the air and sunshine, \""rejoice in your fresh youth in the free air!\"" But it took no notice and just grew and grew; there it stood fresh and green in winter and summer, and all who saw it said, \""What a beautiful tree!\"" And at Christmas-time, it was the first to be cut down. The axe went deep into the pith; the tree fell to the ground with a groan; it felt bruised and faint. It could not think of happiness; it was sad at leaving its home, the spot where it had sprung up; it knew, too, that it would never see again its dear old companions, or the little shrubs and flowers, perhaps not even the birds. Altogether, the parting was not pleasant.\n\nWhen the tree came to itself again, it was packed in a yard with other trees, and a man was saying, \""This is a splendid one, we shall only want this.\"" Then came two footmen in livery and carried the fir-tree to a large and beautiful room. There were pictures hanging on the walls, and near the Dutch stove stood great Chinese vases with lions on their lids; there were armchairs, silk-covered sofas, big tables laden with picture-books and toys, worth hundreds of pounds\u2014at least, so the children said. The fir-tree was placed in a great tub filled with sand, but no one could see that it was a tub, for it was all hung with greenery and stood on a gay carpet. How the tree trembled! What was coming now? On its branches, they hung little nets cut out of colored paper, each full of sugarplums; gilt apples and nuts hung down as if they were growing, over a hundred red, blue, and white tapers were fastened among the branches. Dolls as life-like as human beings\u2014the fir-tree had never seen any before\u2014were suspended among the green, and right up at the top was fixed a gold tinsel star; it was gorgeous, quite unusually gorgeous!\n\n\""To-night,\"" they all said, \""to-night it will be lighted!\"" \""Ah!\"" thought the tree, \""if it were only evening! Then the tapers would soon be lighted. What will happen then? I wonder whether the trees will come from the wood to see me, or if the sparrows will fly against the window panes? Am I to stand here decked out thus through winter and summer?\"" It was not a bad guess, but the fir-tree had real bark-ache from sheer longing, and bark-ache in trees is just as bad as head-ache in human beings.\n\nNow the tapers were lighted. What a glitter! What splendour! The tree quivered in all its branches so much that one of the candles caught the green and singed it. \""Take care!\"" cried the young ladies, and they extinguished it. Now the tree did not even dare to quiver. It was really terrible! It was so afraid of losing any of its ornaments, and it was quite bewildered by all the radiance.\n\nAnd then the folding doors were opened, and a crowd of children rushed in, as though they wanted to knock down the whole tree, whilst the older people followed soberly. The children stood quite silent, but only for a moment, and then they shouted again, and danced round the tree, and snatched off one present after another. \""What are they doing?\"" thought the tree. \""What is going to happen?\"" And the tapers burnt low on the branches, and were put out one by one, and then the children were given permission to plunder the tree. They rushed at it so that all its boughs creaked; if it had not been fastened by the gold star at the top to the ceiling, it would have been overthrown.\n\nThe children danced about with their splendid toys, and no one looked at the tree, except the old nurse, who came and peeped amongst the boughs, just to see if a fig or an apple had been forgotten. \""A story! a story!\"" cried the children, and dragged a little stout man to the tree; he sat down beneath it, saying, \""Here we are in the greenwood, and the tree will be delighted to listen! But I am only going to tell one story. Shall it be Henny Penny or Humpty Dumpty who fell downstairs, and yet gained great honour and married a princess?\"" \""Henny Penny!\"" cried some; \""Humpty Dumpty!\"" cried others; there was a perfect babel of voices! Only the fir-tree kept silent and thought, \""Am I not to be in it? Am I to have nothing to do with it?\""\n\nBut it had already been in it and played out its part. And the man told them about Humpty Dumpty who fell downstairs and married a princess. The children clapped their hands and cried, \""Another! another!\"" They wanted the story of Henny Penny also, but they only got Humpty Dumpty. The fir-tree stood quite astonished and thoughtful; the birds in the wood had never related anything like that. \""Humpty Dumpty fell downstairs and yet married a princess! Yes, that is the way of the world!\"" thought the tree, and was sure it must be true because such a nice man had told the story. \""Well, who knows? Perhaps I shall fall downstairs and marry a princess.\"" And it rejoiced to think that next day it would be decked out again with candles, toys, glittering ornaments, and fruits. \""To-morrow I shall quiver again with excitement. I shall enjoy to the full all my splendour. To-morrow I shall hear Humpty Dumpty again, and perhaps Henny Penny too.\"" And the tree stood silent and lost in thought all through the night.\n\nNext morning the servants came in. \""Now the dressing up will begin again,\"" thought the tree. But they dragged it out of the room, and up the stairs to the lumber-room, and put it in a dark corner, where no ray of light could penetrate. \""What does this mean?\"" thought the tree. \""What am I to do here? What is there for me to hear?\"" And it leaned against the wall and thought and thought. And there was time enough for that, for days and nights went by, and no one came; at last, when someone did come, it was only to put some great boxes into the corner. Now the tree was quite covered; it seemed as if it had been quite forgotten.\n\n\""Now it is winter outdoors,\"" thought the fir-tree. \""The ground is hard and covered with snow; they can't plant me yet, and that is why I am staying here under cover till the spring comes. How thoughtful they are! Only I wish it were not so terribly dark and lonely here; not even a little hare! It was so nice out in the wood when the snow lay all around, and the hare leapt past me; yes, even when he leapt over me: but I didn't like it then. It's so dreadfully lonely up here.\""\n\n\""Squeak, squeak!\"" said a little mouse, stealing out, followed by a second. They sniffed at the fir-tree and then crept between its boughs. \""It's frightfully cold,\"" said the little mice. \""How nice it is to be here! Don't you think so too, you old fir-tree?\"" \""I'm not at all old,\"" said the tree; \""there are many much older than I am.\"" \""Where do you come from?\"" asked the mice, \""and what do you know?\"" They were extremely inquisitive. \""Do tell us about the most beautiful place in the world. Is that where you come from? Have you been in the storeroom, where cheeses lie on the shelves, and hams hang from the ceiling, where one dances on tallow candles, and where one goes in thin and comes out fat?\"" \""I know nothing about that,\"" said the tree. \""But I know the wood, where the sun shines, and the birds sing.\"" And then it told them all about its young days, and the little mice had never heard anything like that before, and they listened with all their ears, and said: \""Oh, how much you have seen! How lucky you have been!\""\n\n\""I?\"" said the fir-tree, and then it thought over what it had told them. \""Yes, on the whole those were very happy times.\"" But then it went on to tell them about Christmas Eve, when it had been adorned with sweet-meats and tapers. \""Oh!\"" said the little mice, \""how lucky you have been, you old fir-tree!\"" \""I'm not at all old,\"" said the tree. \""I only came from the wood this winter. I am only a little backward, perhaps, in my growth.\"" \""How beautifully you tell stories!\"" said the little mice. And next evening they came with four others, who wanted to hear the tree's story, and it told still more, for it remembered everything so clearly and thought: \""Those were happy times! But they may come again. Humpty Dumpty fell downstairs, and yet he married a princess; perhaps I shall also marry a princess!\"" And then it thought of a pretty little birch-tree that grew out in the wood, and seemed to the fir-tree a real princess, and a very beautiful one too.\n\n\""Who is Humpty Dumpty?\"" asked the little mice. And then the tree told the whole story; it could remember every single word, and the little mice were ready to leap on to the topmost branch out of sheer joy! Next night many more mice came, and on Sunday even two rats; but they did not care about the story, and that troubled the little mice, for now they thought less of it too. \""Is that the only story you know?\"" asked the rats. \""The only one,\"" answered the tree. \""I heard that on my happiest evening, but I did not realize then how happy I was.\"" \""That's a very poor story. Don't you know one about bacon or tallow candles? A storeroom story?\"" \""No,\"" said the tree. \""Then we are much obliged to you,\"" said the rats, and they went back to their friends.\n\nAt last, the little mice went off also, and the tree said, sighing: \""Really it was very pleasant when the lively little mice sat round and listened whilst I told them stories. But now that's over too. But now I will think of the time when I shall be brought out again, to keep up my spirits.\"" But when did that happen? Well, it was one morning when they came to tidy up the lumber-room; they threw it really rather roughly on the floor, but a servant dragged it off at once downstairs, where there was daylight once more. \""Now life begins again!\"" thought the tree. It felt the fresh air, the first rays of the sun, and there it was out in the yard! Everything passed so quickly; the tree quite forgot to notice itself; there was so much to look at all around. The yard opened on a garden full of flowers; the roses were so fresh and sweet, hanging over a little trellis, the lime-trees were in blossom, and the swallows flew about, saying: \""Quirre-virre-vil, my husband has come home;\"" but it was not the fir-tree they meant.\n\n\""Now I shall live,\"" thought the tree joyfully, stretching out its branches wide; but, alas! they were all withered and yellow; and it was lying in a corner among weeds and nettles. The golden star was still on its highest bough, and it glittered in the bright sunlight. In the yard, some of the merry children were playing, who had danced so gaily round the tree at Christmas. One of the little ones ran up and tore off the gold star. \""Look what was left on the ugly old fir-tree!\"" he cried, and stamped on the boughs so that they cracked under his feet.\n\nAnd the tree looked at all the splendour and freshness of the flowers in the garden, and then looked at itself, and wished that it had been left lying in the dark corner of the lumber-room; it thought of its fresh youth in the wood, of the merry Christmas Eve, and of the little mice who had listened so happily to the story of Humpty Dumpty. \""Too late! Too late!\"" thought the old tree. \""If only I had enjoyed myself whilst I could. Now all is over and gone.\""\n\nAnd a servant came and cut the tree into small pieces; there was quite a bundle of them; they flickered brightly under the great copper in the brew-house; the tree sighed deeply, and each sigh was like a pistol-shot; so the children who were playing there ran up and sat in front of the fire, gazing at it, and crying, \""Piff! puff! bang!\"" But for each report, which was really a sigh, the tree was thinking of a summer's day in the wood, or of a winter's night out there, when the stars were shining; it thought of Christmas Eve, and of Humpty Dumpty, which was the only story it had heard, or could tell, and then the tree had burnt away.\n\nThe children played on in the garden, and the youngest had the golden star on his breast, which the tree had worn on the happiest evening of its life; and now that was past\u2014and the tree had passed away\u2014and the story too, all ended and done with. And that's the way with all stories!"""
68,The Flower Queens Daughter,"""A young Prince was riding one day through a meadow that stretched for miles in front of him when he came to a deep open ditch. He was turning aside to avoid it when he heard the sound of someone crying in the ditch. He dismounted from his horse and stepped along in the direction the sound came from. To his astonishment, he found an old woman who begged him to help her out of the ditch. The Prince bent down and lifted her out of her living grave, asking her at the same time how she had managed to get there.\n\n\""My son,\"" answered the old woman, \""I am a very poor woman, and soon after midnight I set out for the neighboring town in order to sell my eggs in the market on the following morning; but I lost my way in the dark and fell into this deep ditch, where I might have remained forever but for your kindness.\"" Then the Prince said to her, \""You can hardly walk; I will put you on my horse and lead you home. Where do you live?\"" \n\n\""Over there, at the edge of the forest in the little hut you see in the distance,\"" replied the old woman. The Prince lifted her onto his horse, and soon they reached the hut, where the old woman got down. Turning to the Prince, she said, \""Just wait a moment, and I will give you something.\"" She disappeared into her hut but returned very soon and said, \""You are a mighty Prince, but at the same time, you have a kind heart, which deserves to be rewarded. Would you like to have the most beautiful woman in the world for your wife?\"" \n\n\""Most certainly I would,\"" replied the Prince. So the old woman continued, \""The most beautiful woman in the whole world is the daughter of the Queen of the Flowers, who has been captured by a dragon. If you wish to marry her, you must first set her free, and this I will help you to do. I will give you this little bell: if you ring it once, the King of the Eagles will appear; if you ring it twice, the King of the Foxes will come to you; and if you ring it three times, you will see the King of the Fishes by your side. These will help you if you are in any difficulty. Now farewell, and heaven prosper your undertaking.\"" She handed him the little bell, and there disappeared hut and all, as though the earth had swallowed her up.\n\nWhen it dawned on the Prince that he had been speaking to a good fairy, he put the little bell carefully in his pocket and rode home. He told his father that he meant to set the daughter of the Flower Queen free and intended to set out the following day into the wide world in search of the maid. The next morning, the Prince mounted his fine horse and left his home. He roamed round the world for a whole year, and his horse died of exhaustion while he himself suffered much from want and misery, but still, he had come upon no trace of her he was in search of.\n\nAt last, one day, he came to a hut, in front of which sat a very old man. The Prince asked him, \""Do you not know where the Dragon lives who keeps the daughter of the Flower Queen prisoner?\"" \""No, I do not,\"" answered the old man. \""But if you go straight along this road for a year, you will reach a hut where my father lives, and possibly he may be able to tell you.\"" The Prince thanked him for his information and continued his journey for a whole year along the same road. At the end of it, he came to the little hut, where he found a very old man. He asked him the same question, and the old man answered, \""No, I do not know where the Dragon lives. But go straight along this road for another year, and you will come to a hut in which my father lives. I know he can tell you.\""\n\nAnd so the Prince wandered on for another year, always on the same road, and at last reached the hut where he found the third old man. He put the same question to him as he had put to his son and grandson; but this time the old man answered, \""The Dragon lives up there on the mountain, and he has just begun his year of sleep. For one whole year he is always awake, and the next he sleeps. But if you wish to see the Flower Queen's daughter, go up the second mountain: the Dragon's old mother lives there, and she has a ball every night, to which the Flower Queen's daughter goes regularly.\""\n\nSo the Prince went up the second mountain, where he found a castle all made of gold with diamond windows. He opened the big gate leading into the courtyard and was just going to walk in when seven dragons rushed on him and asked him what he wanted. The Prince replied, \""I have heard so much of the beauty and kindness of the Dragon's Mother, and would like to enter her service.\"" This flattering speech pleased the dragons, and the eldest of them said, \""Well, you may come with me, and I will take you to the Mother Dragon.\""\n\nThey entered the castle and walked through twelve splendid halls, all made of gold and diamonds. In the twelfth room, they found the Mother Dragon seated on a diamond throne. She was the ugliest woman under the sun, and, added to it all, she had three heads. Her appearance was a great shock to the Prince, and so was her voice, which was like the croaking of many ravens. She asked him, \""Why have you come here?\"" The Prince answered at once, \""I have heard so much of your beauty and kindness that I would very much like to enter your service.\"" \n\n\""Very well,\"" said the Mother Dragon; \""but if you wish to enter my service, you must first lead my mare out to the meadow and look after her for three days; but if you don't bring her home safely every evening, we will eat you up.\"" The Prince undertook the task and led the mare out to the meadow. But no sooner had they reached the grass than she vanished. The Prince sought for her in vain, and at last, in despair, sat down on a big stone and contemplated his sad fate. As he sat thus lost in thought, he noticed an eagle flying over his head. Then he suddenly bethought him of his little bell, and taking it out of his pocket, he rang it once.\n\nIn a moment, he heard a rustling sound in the air beside him, and the King of the Eagles sank at his feet. \""I know what you want of me,\"" the bird said. \""You are looking for the Mother Dragon's mare who is galloping about among the clouds. I will summon all the eagles of the air together and order them to catch the mare and bring her to you.\"" And with these words, the King of the Eagles flew away. Towards evening, the Prince heard a mighty rushing sound in the air, and when he looked up, he saw thousands of eagles driving the mare before them. They sank at his feet on the ground and gave the mare over to him. Then the Prince rode home to the old Mother Dragon, who was full of wonder when she saw him and said, \""You have succeeded today in looking after my mare, and as a reward, you shall come to my ball tonight.\"" She gave him at the same time a cloak made of copper and led him to a big room where several young he-dragons and she-dragons were dancing together. Here, too, was the Flower Queen's beautiful daughter. Her dress was woven out of the most lovely flowers in the world, and her complexion was like lilies and roses. As the Prince was dancing with her, he managed to whisper in her ear, \""I have come to set you free!\""\n\nThen the beautiful girl said to him, \""If you succeed in bringing the mare back safely the third day, ask the Mother Dragon to give you a foal of the mare as a reward.\"" The ball came to an end at midnight, and early the next morning, the Prince again led the Mother Dragon's mare out into the meadow. But again she vanished before his eyes. Then he took out his little bell and rang it twice. In a moment, the King of the Foxes stood before him and said, \""I know already what you want, and will summon all the foxes of the world together to find the mare who has hidden herself in a hill.\""\n\nWith these words, the King of the Foxes disappeared, and in the evening, many thousand foxes brought the mare to the Prince. Then he rode home to the Mother Dragon, from whom he received this time a cloak made of silver, and again she led him to the ballroom. The Flower Queen's daughter was delighted to see him safe and sound, and when they were dancing together, she whispered in his ear: \""If you succeed again tomorrow, wait for me with the foal in the meadow. After the ball, we will fly away together.\""\n\nOn the third day, the Prince led the mare to the meadow again; but once more she vanished before his eyes. Then the Prince took out his little bell and rang it three times. In a moment, the King of the Fishes appeared and said to him: \""I know quite well what you want me to do, and I will summon all the fishes of the sea together and tell them to bring you back the mare, who is hiding herself in a river.\"" Towards evening, the mare was returned to him, and when he led her home to the Mother Dragon, she said to him: \""You are a brave youth, and I will make you my body-servant. But what shall I give you as a reward to begin with?\""\n\nThe Prince begged for a foal of the mare, which the Mother Dragon at once gave him, and over and above, a cloak made of gold, for she had fallen in love with him because he had praised her beauty. So in the evening, he appeared at the ball in his golden cloak; but before the entertainment was over, he slipped away and went straight to the stables, where he mounted his foal and rode out into the meadow to wait for the Flower Queen's daughter. Towards midnight, the beautiful girl appeared, and placing her in front of him on his horse, the Prince and she flew like the wind till they reached the Flower Queen's dwelling.\n\nBut the dragons had noticed their flight and woke their brother out of his year's sleep. He flew into a terrible rage when he heard what had happened and determined to lay siege to the Flower Queen's palace; but the Queen caused a forest of flowers as high as the sky to grow up around her dwelling, through which no one could force a way. When the Flower Queen heard that her daughter wanted to marry the Prince, she said to him: \""I will give my consent to your marriage gladly, but my daughter can only stay with you in summer. In winter, when everything is dead and the ground covered with snow, she must come and live with me in my palace underground.\"" \n\nThe Prince consented to this and led his beautiful bride home, where the wedding was held with great pomp and magnificence. The young couple lived happily together till winter came, when the Flower Queen's daughter departed and went home to her mother. In summer, she returned to her husband, and their life of joy and happiness began again, lasting till the approach of winter, when the Flower Queen's daughter went back again to her mother. This coming and going continued all her life long, and in spite of it, they always lived happily together."""
73,he Magic Bon Bons,"""There lived in Boston a wise and ancient chemist by the name of Dr. Daws, who dabbled somewhat in magic. There also lived in Boston a young lady by the name of Claribel Sudds, who was possessed of much money, little wit, and an intense desire to go upon the stage. \n\nSo Claribel went to Dr. Daws and said, \""I can neither sing nor dance; I cannot recite verse nor play upon the piano; I am no acrobat nor leaper nor high kicker; yet I wish to go upon the stage. What shall I do?\"" \n\n\""Are you willing to pay for such accomplishments?\"" asked the wise chemist. \n\n\""Certainly,\"" answered Claribel, jingling her purse. \n\n\""Then come to me tomorrow at two o'clock,\"" said he. \n\nAll that night he practiced what is known as chemical sorcery; so that when Claribel Sudds came the next day at two o'clock, he showed her a small box filled with compounds that closely resembled French bonbons. \n\n\""This is a progressive age,\"" said the old man, \""and I flatter myself your Uncle Daws keeps right along with the procession. Now, one of your old-fashioned sorcerers would have made you some nasty, bitter pills to swallow; but I have consulted your taste and convenience. Here are some magic bonbons. If you eat this one with the lavender color, you can dance thereafter as lightly and gracefully as if you had been trained a lifetime. After you consume the pink confection, you will sing like a nightingale. Eating the white one will enable you to become the finest elocutionist in the land. The chocolate piece will charm you into playing the piano better than Rubenstein, while after eating your lemon-yellow bonbon, you can easily kick six feet above your head.\"" \n\n\""How delightful!\"" exclaimed Claribel, who was truly enraptured. \""You are certainly a most clever sorcerer as well as a considerate compounder,\"" and she held out her hand for the box. \n\n\""Ahem!\"" said the wise one; \""a check, please.\"" \n\n\""Oh, yes; to be sure! How stupid of me to forget it,\"" she returned. \n\nHe considerately retained the box in his own hand while she signed a check for a large amount of money, after which he allowed her to hold the box herself. \n\n\""Are you sure you have made them strong enough?\"" she inquired anxiously; \""it usually takes a great deal to affect me.\"" \n\n\""My only fear,\"" replied Dr. Daws, \""is that I have made them too strong. For this is the first time I have ever been called upon to prepare these wonderful confections.\"" \n\n\""Don't worry,\"" said Claribel; \""the stronger they act, the better I shall act myself.\"" \n\nShe went away, after saying this, but stopping in at a dry goods store to shop, she forgot the precious box in her new interest and left it lying on the ribbon counter. \n\nThen little Bessie Bostwick came to the counter to buy a hair ribbon and laid her parcels beside the box. When she went away, she gathered up the box with her other bundles and trotted off home with it. \n\nBessie never knew, until after she had hung her coat in the hall closet and counted up her parcels, that she had one too many. Then she opened it and exclaimed, \""Why, it's a box of candy! Someone must have mislaid it. But it is too small a matter to worry about; there are only a few pieces.\"" So she dumped the contents of the box into a bonbon dish that stood upon the hall table and, picking out the chocolate piece\u2014she was fond of chocolates\u2014ate it daintily while she examined her purchases. \n\nThese were not many, for Bessie was only twelve years old and was not yet trusted by her parents to expend much money at the stores. But while she tried on the hair ribbon, she suddenly felt a great desire to play upon the piano, and the desire at last became so overpowering that she went into the parlor and opened the instrument. \n\nThe little girl had, with infinite pains, contrived to learn two \""pieces\"" which she usually executed with a jerky movement of her right hand and a left hand that forgot to keep up and so made dreadful discords. But under the influence of the chocolate bonbon, she sat down and ran her fingers lightly over the keys, producing such exquisite harmony that she was filled with amazement at her own performance. \n\nThat was the prelude, however. The next moment she dashed into Beethoven's seventh sonata and played it magnificently. Her mother, hearing the unusual burst of melody, came downstairs to see what musical guest had arrived; but when she discovered it was her own little daughter who was playing so divinely, she had an attack of palpitation of the heart (to which she was subject) and sat down upon a sofa until it should pass away. \n\nMeanwhile, Bessie played one piece after another with untiring energy. She loved music, and now found that all she need do was to sit at the piano and listen and watch her hands twinkle over the keyboard. \n\nTwilight deepened in the room, and Bessie's father came home and hung up his hat and overcoat and placed his umbrella in the rack. Then he peeped into the parlor to see who was playing. \n\n\""Great Caesar!\"" he exclaimed. But the mother came to him softly with her finger on her lips and whispered, \""Don't interrupt her, John. Our child seems to be in a trance. Did you ever hear such superb music?\"" \n\n\""Why, she's an infant prodigy!\"" gasped the astounded father. \""Beats Blind Tom all hollow! It's\u2014it's wonderful!\"" \n\nAs they stood listening, the senator arrived, having been invited to dine with them that evening. And before he had taken off his coat, the Yale professor\u2014a man of deep learning and scholarly attainments\u2014joined the party. \n\nBessie played on; and the four elders stood in a huddled but silent and amazed group, listening to the music and waiting for the sound of the dinner gong. \n\nMr. Bostwick, who was hungry, picked up the bonbon dish that lay on the table beside him and ate the pink confection. The professor was watching him, so Mr. Bostwick courteously held the dish toward him. The professor ate the lemon-yellow piece, and the senator reached out his hand and took the lavender piece. He did not eat it, however, for, chancing to remember that it might spoil his dinner, he put it in his vest pocket. Mrs. Bostwick, still intently listening to her precocious daughter, without thinking what she did, took the remaining piece, which was the white one, and slowly devoured it. \n\nThe dish was now empty, and Claribel Sudds' precious bonbons had passed from her possession forever! \n\nSuddenly Mr. Bostwick, who was a big man, began to sing in a shrill, tremolo soprano voice. It was not the same song Bessie was playing, and the discord was shocking that the professor smiled, the senator put his hands to his ears, and Mrs. Bostwick cried in a horrified voice, \""William!\"" \n\nHer husband continued to sing as if endeavoring to emulate the famous Christine Nillson and paid no attention whatever to his wife or his guests. \n\nFortunately, the dinner gong now sounded, and Mrs. Bostwick dragged Bessie from the piano and ushered her guests into the dining room. Mr. Bostwick followed, singing \""The Last Rose of Summer\"" as if it had been an encore demanded by a thousand delighted hearers. \n\nThe poor woman was in despair at witnessing her husband's undignified actions and wondered what she might do to control him. The professor seemed more grave than usual; the senator's face wore an offended expression, and Bessie kept moving her fingers as if she still wanted to play the piano. \n\nMrs. Bostwick managed to get them all seated, although her husband had broken into another aria; and then the maid brought in the soup. \n\nWhen she carried a plate to the professor, he cried, in an excited voice, \""Hold it higher! Higher\u2014I say!\"" And springing up, he gave it a sudden kick that sent it nearly to the ceiling, from whence the dish descended to scatter soup over Bessie and the maid and to smash in pieces upon the crown of the professor's bald head. \n\nAt this atrocious act, the senator rose from his seat with an exclamation of horror and glanced at his hostess. \n\nFor some time, Mrs. Bostwick had been staring straight ahead, with a dazed expression; but now, catching the senator's eye, she bowed gracefully and began reciting \""The Charge of the Light Brigade\"" in forceful tones. \n\nThe senator shuddered. Such disgraceful rioting he had never seen nor heard before in a decent private family. He felt that his reputation was at stake, and, being the only sane person, apparently, in the room, there was no one to whom he might appeal. \n\nThe maid had run away to cry hysterically in the kitchen; Mr. Bostwick was singing \""O Promise Me;\"" the professor was trying to kick the globes off the chandelier; Mrs. Bostwick had switched her recitation to \""The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck,\"" and Bessie had stolen into the parlor and was pounding out the overture from the \""Flying Dutchman.\"" \n\nThe senator was not at all sure he would not go crazy himself, presently; so he slipped away from the turmoil, and, catching up his hat and coat in the hall, hurried from the house. \n\nThat night he sat up late writing a political speech he was to deliver the next afternoon at Faneuil Hall, but his experiences at the Bostwicks' had so unnerved him that he could scarcely collect his thoughts, and often he would pause and shake his head pityingly as he remembered the strange things he had seen in that usually respectable home. \n\nThe next day he met Mr. Bostwick in the street, but passed him by with a stony glare of oblivion. He felt he really could not afford to know this gentleman in the future. Mr. Bostwick was naturally indignant at the direct snub; yet in his mind lingered a faint memory of some quite unusual occurrences at his dinner party the evening before, and he hardly knew whether he dared resent the senator's treatment or not. \n\nThe political meeting was the feature of the day, for the senator's eloquence was well known in Boston. So the big hall was crowded with people, and in one of the front rows sat the Bostwick family, with the learned Yale professor beside them. They all looked tired and pale, as if they had passed a rather dissipated evening, and the senator was rendered so nervous by seeing them that he refused to look in their direction a second time. \n\nWhile the mayor was introducing him, the great man sat fidgeting in his chair; and, happening to put his thumb and finger into his vest pocket, he found the lavender-colored bonbon he had placed there the evening before. \n\n\""This may clear my throat,\"" thought the senator, and slipped the bonbon into his mouth. \n\nA few minutes afterward, he arose before the vast audience, which greeted him with enthusiastic plaudits. \n\n\""My friends,\"" began the senator, in a grave voice, \""this is a most impressive and important occasion.\"" \n\nThen he paused, balanced himself upon his left foot, and kicked his right leg into the air in the way favored by ballet dancers! \n\nThere was a hum of amazement and horror from the spectators, but the senator appeared not to notice it. He whirled around upon the tips of his toes, kicked right and left in a graceful manner, and startled a bald-headed man in the front row by casting a languishing glance in his direction. \n\nSuddenly Claribel Sudds, who happened to be present, uttered a scream and sprang to her feet. Pointing an accusing finger at the dancing senator, she cried in a loud voice, \""That's the man who stole my bonbons! Seize him! Arrest him! Don't let him escape!\"" \n\nBut the ushers rushed her out of the hall, thinking she had gone suddenly insane; and the senator's friends seized him firmly and carried him out the stage entrance to the street, where they put him into an open carriage and instructed the driver to take him home. \n\nThe effect of the magic bonbon was still powerful enough to control the poor senator, who stood upon the rear seat of the carriage and danced energetically all the way home, to the delight of the crowd of small boys who followed the carriage and the grief of the sober-minded citizens, who shook their heads sadly and whispered that \""another good man had gone wrong.\"" \n\nIt took the senator several months to recover from the shame and humiliation of this escapade; and, curiously enough, he never had the slightest idea what had induced him to act in so extraordinary a manner. Perhaps it was fortunate the last bonbon had now been eaten, for they might easily have caused considerably more trouble than they did. \n\nOf course, Claribel went again to the wise chemist and signed a check for another box of magic bonbons; but she must have taken better care of these, for she is now a famous vaudeville actress."""
74,The Selfish Giant,"""Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden. It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them. \""How happy we are here!\"" they cried to each other.\n\nOne day the Giant came back. He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre and had stayed with him for seven years. After the seven years were over, he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle. When he arrived, he saw the children playing in the garden. \""What are you doing here?\"" he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away. \""My own garden is my own garden,\"" said the Giant; \""anyone can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.\"" So he built a high wall all around it and put up a notice-board. He was a very selfish Giant.\n\nThe poor children had now nowhere to play. They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it. They used to wander around the high wall when their lessons were over and talk about the beautiful garden inside. \""How happy we were there,\"" they said to each other. Then Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant, it was still winter. The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom. Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board, it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again and went off to sleep. The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost.\n\n\""Spring has forgotten this garden,\"" they cried, \""so we will live here all the year round.\"" The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver. Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came. He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden and blew the chimney-pots down. \""This is a delightful spot,\"" he said, \""we must ask the Hail on a visit.\"" So the Hail came. Every day for three hours, he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.\n\n\""I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,\"" said the Selfish Giant as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; \""I hope there will be a change in the weather.\"" But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant's garden, she gave none. \""He is too selfish,\"" she said. So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.\n\nOne morning, the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music. It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King's musicians passing by. It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world. Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement. \""I believe the Spring has come at last,\"" said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.\n\nWhat did he see? He saw a most wonderful sight. Through a little hole in the wall, the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees. In every tree that he could see, there was a little child. And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms and were waving their arms gently above the children's heads. The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing. It was a lovely scene, only in one corner, it was still winter. It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy. He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all around it, crying bitterly. The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it.\n\n\""Climb up! little boy,\"" said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny. And the Giant's heart melted as he looked out. \""How selfish I have been!\"" he said; \""now I know why the Spring would not come here. I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground forever and ever.\"" He was really very sorry for what he had done.\n\nSo he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly and went out into the garden. But when the children saw him, they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again. Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming. And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand and put him up into the tree. And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them around the Giant's neck and kissed him. And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring. \""It is your garden now, little children,\"" said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall. And when the people were going to market at twelve o'clock, they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.\n\nAll day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him goodbye. \""But where is your little companion?\"" he said: \""the boy I put into the tree.\"" The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him. \""We don't know,\"" answered the children; \""he has gone away.\"" \""You must tell him to be sure and come here tomorrow,\"" said the Giant. But the children said that they did not know where he lived and had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.\n\nEvery afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant. But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again. The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first little friend and often spoke of him. \""How I would like to see him!\"" he used to say. Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble. He could not play about anymore, so he sat in a huge armchair and watched the children at their games and admired his garden. \""I have many beautiful flowers,\"" he said; \""but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all.\""\n\nOne winter morning, he looked out of his window as he was dressing. He did not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep and that the flowers were resting. Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder and looked and looked. It certainly was a marvelous sight. In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms. Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved.\n\nDownstairs ran the Giant in great joy and out into the garden. He hastened across the grass and came near to the child. And when he came quite close, his face grew red with anger, and he said, \""Who hath dared to wound thee?\"" For on the palms of the child's hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet. \""Who hath dared to wound thee?\"" cried the Giant; \""tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him.\"" \n\n\""Nay!\"" answered the child; \""but these are the wounds of Love.\"" \""Who art thou?\"" said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child. And the child smiled on the Giant and said to him, \""You let me play once in your garden; today you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise.\"" And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms."""
76,The Ugly Duckling,"""It was very pleasant out in the country. It was summer time, the corn was yellow, the oats green, and the hay was stacked down in the green meadows. There, the stork walked about on his long red legs and talked Egyptian, a language he had learned from his mother. Round the fields and meadows were large woods and deep lakes, making it a truly delightful place. In the sunshine, an old manor house stood, surrounded by a deep moat, with great dock plants growing tall enough for a little child to stand upright beneath them. It was as lonely among them as in the thickest wood, and there a Duck was sitting on her nest. She was trying to hatch out her little Ducklings, but she was nearly tired out, as they took so long to arrive, and she had very few visitors. The other Ducks preferred swimming about the moat to coming up and sitting under a dock-leaf to chat with her.\n\nAt last, one egg after another cracked open, and the little ones said, \""Pip! pip!\"" All the egg-yolks had come to life and were sticking their heads out. \""Quack, quack!\"" said their mother, and they echoed her as best they could, looking around beneath the green leaves. Their mother allowed them to look as much as they liked, for green is good for the eyes. \""What a big place the world is,\"" said all the young ones, for they certainly had much more room now than when they were in the egg. \""Do you suppose this is all the world?\"" asked their mother. \""Why, it stretches out far beyond the other side of the garden, right into the parson's field\u2014but I've never been there. You're all there, I suppose?\"" she said, getting up. \""No, that's not all; there lies the biggest egg still. How long will it take? I'm really almost sick of it,\"" she added, sitting down again.\n\n\""Well, how goes it?\"" asked an elderly Duck who came to call on her. \""Oh, this one egg takes a dreadful long time,\"" said the sitting Duck; \""it won't break. But just you look at the others! They are the sweetest Ducklings I've ever seen; they're all just like their wretch of a father, who never comes to see me.\"" \""Let me look at the egg that won't hatch,\"" said the old Duck. \""You may be sure that's a turkey's egg. I was made a fool of once that way, and I had my share of trouble and anxiety with the young ones, I can tell you, for they are afraid of the water. I couldn't get them to go in! I quacked and I pecked, but it was no good. Let me see the egg. Ah, yes, that's a turkey's egg; you just let it lie and teach the rest to swim.\"" \""Oh, I'll just sit on it a bit longer,\"" said the Duck. \""As I've sat so long, I may as well give it a Whitsun week!\"" \""Just as you please,\"" said the old Duck, and walked off.\n\nAt last, the big egg opened. \""Pip! pip!\"" said the young one, scrambling out; he was very big and ugly. The Duck looked at him. \""That's a fearfully big Duckling, that is,\"" she said. \""None of the others look like that. I suppose it can't be a turkey poult! Well, we'll soon see; into the water he shall go, if I have to kick him out myself.\"" The next day, the weather was perfectly delicious: the sun shone all over the green docks, and the mother Duck and all her family came out to the moat. Splash! Into the water went she. \""Quack, quack!\"" she said, and one Duckling after another plumped in. The water went over their heads, but they were up again in a moment and swam beautifully. Their legs worked of themselves, and now they were all out in the water, and even the ugly grey one was swimming with them. \""No, no, that's no turkey,\"" she said. \""Look how nicely he uses his legs, and how well he holds himself up. That's my own child! He's really quite handsome if you look at him properly. Quack, quack! Come along with me and I'll take you out into the world and introduce you to the duck-yard, but mind and keep close to me so that nobody can tread on you, and do look out for the cat.\""\n\nSo they went into the duck-yard. There was a terrible commotion there, for two families were quarreling over an eel's head\u2014which the cat got after all. \""Look, that's the way the world goes,\"" said the mother Duck, her beak watering a little, for she would have liked the eel's head herself. \""Now then, use your legs,\"" she said; \""mind and look alive, and stoop your necks to the old Duck over there; she's the most distinguished person here; she's of Spanish descent, so she's something special, and you see she's got a red rag round her leg. That is an extraordinarily splendid thing, the greatest distinction any duck can have; it means that people can't do without her, and she must be recognized by animals and men alike. Now then, look alive! Don't turn your toes in! A duckling that's properly brought up keeps its legs wide apart, like father and mother. Look here! Now then! Make a bow and say quack.\""\n\nSo they did; but the other ducks around them looked at them and said quite loudly, \""Look there! Now we've got to have all this mob on the top of us, as if there weren't enough of us already; and poof! what an object that duckling is! We can't stand him\""; and a duck rushed at him and bit him in the neck. \""Let him be,\"" said his mother; \""he isn't doing any harm.\"" \""Yes, but he's too big and odd altogether,\"" said the duck who had bitten him; \""so he's got to be smacked.\"" \""Those are pretty ducklings that mother has,\"" said the old Duck with the rag on her leg; \""all quite pretty except that one. He hasn't been a success; I could wish the mother would alter him.\"" \""That can't be done, your grace,\"" said the mother Duck. \""He's not handsome, but he has a really good disposition, and swims as nicely as any of the rest, even better, I venture to say. I believe he will grow handsome, or perhaps in time he will grow even somewhat smaller; he has lain too long in the egg, and so has not acquired a proper shape.\"" And she picked at his neck and smoothed him down. \""Besides, he's a drake,\"" she went on, \""so it doesn't matter quite so much. He has, I believe, a good constitution and will win through in the end.\""\n\n\""The other ducklings are charming,\"" said the old lady. \""Well, make yourselves at home, and if you happen to find an eel's head, you can bring it to me.\"" So they made themselves at home, but the poor Duckling who had come last out of the egg and looked so ugly was bitten and buffeted and made to look a fool by the hens and the ducks alike. \""He's too big,\"" they all said; and the turkey cock, who was born with spurs and considered himself an emperor on the strength of it, blew himself up like a ship under full sail and went straight at the Duckling, gobbling and getting quite red in the head. The poor Duckling didn't know where to stay or which way to go; he was so miserable at being ugly and the butt of the whole duck-yard.\n\nThat was the first day, and as time went on, it got worse and worse. The wretched Duckling was chased about by everybody, and even his mother and sisters were nasty to him, saying, \""I wish the cat would get you, you ugly devil.\"" His mother said, \""I wish you'd get right away\""; and the ducks bit him, the hens pecked him, and the maid who had to feed the creatures kicked at him. So he ran away and flew over the fence. The little birds in the bushes shot up in the air in fright. \""That's because I'm so ugly,\"" the Duckling thought, and shut his eyes, but ran on all the same until he got out into the wide marsh where the wild-duck lived; and there he lay all night, for he was very tired and very unhappy.\n\nIn the morning, the wild-duck flew up and caught sight of their new comrade. \""What sort of a chap are you?\"" they asked, and the Duckling turned to this side and that and greeted them as well as he could. \""You're precious ugly,\"" said the wild-ducks; \""but that doesn't matter to us as long as you don't marry into our family.\"" Poor wretch! He wasn't thinking much about marrying, as long as he could be allowed to lie among the reeds and drink a little marsh water. There he lay for two whole days, and then came a pair of wild geese (or rather wild ganders, for they were both males): they hadn't been hatched out very long, and so they were particularly lively. \""Here, mate,\"" they said, \""you're so ugly I quite like you. Will you come along and be a migrant? Close by in another marsh, there are some sweet pretty wild geese\u2014all young ladies that can say Quack. You're so ugly you could make your fortune with them.\""\n\nAt that moment, there was a Bang! Bang! and both the wild geese fell dead among the reeds, and the water was stained blood red. Another bang! bang! and whole flights of geese flew up from the reeds, and there was yet another bang! A great shoot was afoot. The sportsmen were all around the marsh, some even sitting up among the branches of trees that stretched out over the reeds. The blue smoke drifted like clouds among the dark stems and hung far out over the water. The dogs went splash! splash! into the mud, and the reeds and rushes swayed hither and thither; it was terrible for the wretched Duckling, who was bending his neck to get it under his wing when all at once, close to him, there was a fearfully big dog with his tongue hanging right out of his mouth and his eyes shining horribly. He thrust his muzzle right at the Duckling and showed his sharp teeth\u2014and then\u2014splash! Off he went without seizing him.\n\n\""Oh, thank goodness,\"" sighed the Duckling; \""I'm so ugly, even the dog doesn't like to bite me!\"" But there he lay perfectly still while the duck shots rattled in the reeds and gun after gun banged out. It was well on in the day before all was quiet, but the unhappy bird dared not get up even then. He waited several hours more before he looked about him, and then he hurried away from the marsh as fast as he could, running over fields and meadows, and such a wind got up that he had hard work to get along. Towards evening, he was near a poor little cottage, so crazy that it didn't know which way to tumble down, so it remained standing. The wind howled so fiercely around the Duckling that he had to sit down on his tail to keep facing it, and it grew worse and worse. Then he noticed that one hinge of the door was gone, and it hung so crooked that he could slip indoors through the crack, and so he did.\n\nHere lived an old woman with a cat and a hen. The cat, whom she called Sonny, could set up his fur and purr, and also throw out sparks, but for this, he had to be stroked backwards. The Hen had very short little legs and was consequently called \""chicky short legs.\"" She laid good eggs, and the woman was as fond of her as of a child of her own. The next morning, the strange Duckling was noticed at once, and the cat began to purr, and the Hen to cluck. \""What's the matter?\"" said the old woman, looking all about her. But her sight wasn't good, so she took the Duckling for a fat duck that had strayed away. \""That's a splendid catch,\"" she said: \""now I can have duck eggs, if only it isn't a drake! We must make sure of that.\"" So the Duckling was taken in on approval for three weeks, but no eggs came.\n\nThe Cat was the gentleman of the house and the Hen the lady, and they always talked of \""we and the world\""; for they considered that they were half the world, and much the best half. It seemed to the Duckling that some people might think differently, but this the Hen could not tolerate. \""Can you lay eggs?\"" she asked. \""No! Then will you kindly hold your tongue.\"" And the Cat said: \""Can you put up your fur, or purr, or give out sparks? No! Then you've no call to have an opinion when sensible people are talking.\"" So the Duckling lay in a corner and was in the lowest spirits. He began to think of the fresh air and sunshine, and such a strange longing to swim in the water came over him that he could not help telling the Hen.\n\n\""What's the matter with you?\"" she asked. \""You've nothing to do, that's why you get these fancies; you just lay some eggs, or purr, and they'll pass off.\"" \""But it is so delicious to float on the water,\"" said the Duckling; \""so lovely to get it over your head and dive right down to the bottom.\"" \""Oh yes, most delightful, of course!\"" said the Hen. \""Why, you're absolutely mad! Ask the Cat\u2014he's the cleverest man I know\u2014whether he enjoys floating on the water or diving down; I say nothing of myself. Why, ask your mistress, the old woman; there's no one in the world cleverer than her\u2014do you suppose she wants to go swimming and getting the water over her head?\"" \""You don't understand me,\"" said the Duckling. \""Well, if we don't understand you, who is going to understand you, pray? You'll never be cleverer than the Cat and the woman, to say nothing of me. Don't give yourself airs, child, but thank your Maker for all the kindness people have done you. Don't you live in a warm room among company you can learn something from? But there! You're a rubbishy thing, and there's little entertainment in your company. You may take it from me! I mean well by you, and I'm telling you home truths, and that's how people can see their true friends. Now just do take pains to lay eggs, or learn to purr or else give sparks.\""\n\n\""I think I'll go out into the wide world,\"" said the Duckling. \""Very well, do,\"" said the Hen. So the Duckling went off and swam on the water and dived into it; but he was looked down upon by all the creatures because of his ugliness. Autumn now came on: the leaves of the wood turned brown and yellow, the wind caught them and made them dance about, and above, the sky looked cold, where the clouds hung heavy with hail and snow, and on the fence, the raven perched and cried \""Caw! Caw!\"" for the mere cold. Indeed, it regularly gave you the shivers to think of it. The unhappy Duckling had a very hard time.\n\nOne evening, when there was a lovely sunset, a whole flock of beautiful great birds rose out of the bushes. The Duckling had never seen any so handsome. They were brilliantly white, with long supple necks. They were swans, and they uttered a strange sound and spread their splendid long wings and flew far away from the cold region to warmer lands and unfrozen lakes. They mounted so high, so high that the ugly little Duckling was strangely moved; he whirled himself round in the water like a wheel, stretched his neck straight up into the air after them, and uttered such a loud cry, so strange, that he was quite frightened at it himself. Oh, he could not forget those beautiful birds, those wonderful birds! And the moment they were out of sight, he dived right down to the bottom of the water, and when he came up again, he was almost beside himself. He didn't know what the birds were called or which way they were flying, but he loved them as he had never loved anything yet. He was not envious of them\u2014how could it enter his mind to wish for such beauty for himself? He would have been happy if even the ducks had let him into their company\u2014poor ugly creature.\n\nThe winter grew very cold: the Duckling was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing quite over, but every night the hole he swam in became smaller and smaller. It froze so hard that the ice cracked again; the Duckling had always to be moving about to keep the water open, until at last he was tired out and sat still, and was frozen fast in the ice. Early in the morning, a laborer came that way, saw him, went on the ice, and with his wooden shoe broke it up and carried the Duckling home to his wife, and there he was brought to life again. The children wanted to play with him, but he thought they meant to hurt him, and in his fright, he dashed right into the milk-pan and made the milk splash out into the room. The woman screamed and threw up her hands. Then he flew into the butter-tub and after that into the meal-bin and out again. Goodness, what a sight he was! The woman screamed out and hit at him with the tongs, and the children tumbled over one another trying to catch him, laughing and calling out\u2014by good luck the door stood open, and out he rushed into the bushes, on the new fallen snow, and there he lay almost in a swoon.\n\nBut it would be too sad to tell of all the hardships and miseries he had to go through in that hard winter. When the sun began once more to shine out warm and the larks to sing, he was lying among the reeds in the marsh, and it was the beautiful spring. Then all at once he lifted his wings, and they rustled more strongly than before, and bore him swiftly away; and before he knew it, he was in a spacious garden where apple trees were in blossom, and sweet-smelling lilacs hung on long green boughs right down to the winding moat. Oh, it was lovely here, fresh with spring; and straight in front of him, out of the shadows, came three beautiful white swans with rustling plumage floating lightly on the water. The Duckling recognized the splendid creatures, and a strange sorrowfulness came over him.\n\n\""I will fly to them, these royal birds, and they will peck me to death because I, who am so ugly, dare to approach them; but it doesn't matter; it's better to be killed by them than to be snapped at by the ducks and pecked at by hens and kicked by the servant who looks after the poultry-yard, and suffer all the winter.\"" So he flew out into the open water and swam towards the stately swans, and they saw him and hastened with swelling plumage to meet him. \""Yes, kill me,\"" the poor creature said, bowing his head down to the water, and waited for death. But what did he see in the clear water? He beheld his own image, but it was no longer that of a clumsy dark grey bird, ugly and repulsive. He was a swan himself.\n\nIt doesn't matter in the least whether you are born in the duck-yard, if only you've lain in a swan's egg. It really delighted him now to think of all the hardships and adversities he had suffered; now he could rightly discern his good fortune and all the beauty that greeted him. The great swans swam round him and caressed him with their bills. Some little children now came into the garden and threw bread and corn into the water, and the smallest of them cried: \""There's a new one!\"" And the others called out in delight: \""Yes, there's a new one come!\"" They clapped their hands and danced about and ran to their father and mother. More bread and cake was thrown into the water, and everyone said: \""The new one is the handsomest of all; how young and beautiful he is!\"" And the elder swans bowed before him.\n\nAt that, he felt quite ill at ease and covered his head with his wings, knowing not what to do. He was more than happy, and yet not proud, for a good heart is never puffed up. He thought of how persecuted and depressed he had been, yet now he heard everyone saying he was the most beautiful of all beautiful birds. The lilacs bowed their branches down to the water, the sun shone warm and pleasant, and his plumage ruffled. He raised his slender neck, and from his heart, he said joyfully: \""Such happiness I never dreamed of when I was the Ugly Duckling.\"""""
78,The White Cat,"""Once upon a time, there was a king who had three sons, all so clever and brave that he began to fear they would want to reign over the kingdom before he was dead. Although the King felt he was growing old, he did not wish to relinquish the government of his kingdom while he could still manage it well. To live in peace, he decided to divert the minds of his sons with promises that he could easily evade when the time came to keep them.\n\nHe summoned his sons and spoke to them kindly, saying, \""You will agree with me, my dear children, that my great age makes it impossible for me to look after my affairs of state as carefully as I once did. I fear this may affect the welfare of my subjects. Therefore, I wish one of you to succeed me, but in return for such a gift, you must do something for me. As I think of retiring into the country, I would like a pretty, lively, faithful little dog for company. The one who brings me the most beautiful little dog shall succeed me at once.\""\n\nThe three princes were surprised by their father's sudden fancy for a little dog, but the two younger ones saw it as an opportunity to become king, while the eldest was too polite to object. They accepted the commission with pleasure, bidding farewell to the King, who gave them presents of silver and precious stones. They agreed to meet at the same hour and place after a year to present their dogs.\n\nThe princes set out together to a castle about a league from the city, where they held a grand banquet. They promised to remain friends and not to be parted by envy or jealousy. Each took a different road, and while the two eldest encountered many adventures, it is the youngest prince's story that unfolds here. He was young, handsome, and brave, and he knew everything a prince ought to know. His courage was boundless.\n\nHardly a day passed without him buying several dogs\u2014big and little, greyhounds, mastiffs, spaniels, and lapdogs. However, as soon as he bought a pretty one, he would see an even prettier one and had to get rid of the others. He journeyed aimlessly until he reached a great, gloomy forest at nightfall. As thunder rumbled and rain poured down, he took the first path he could find, hoping to find shelter. Guided by a faint light, he arrived at a magnificent castle with a golden door covered in carbuncles, which shone brightly in the dark.\n\nCurious about who lived in such a splendid castle, he wondered how secure they felt against robbers. He pulled the deer's foot hanging by a chain of diamonds, and the door flew open, revealing numerous hands holding torches. Surprised, he stood still until the hands pushed him forward. With his hand on his sword, he entered a hall paved with lapis-lazuli, where two lovely voices sang:\n\n\""The hands you see floating above  \nWill swiftly your bidding obey;  \nIf your heart dreads not conquering Love,  \nIn this place you may fearlessly stay.\""\n\nBelieving he was safe, the prince followed the hands to a coral door that opened on its own, leading him into a vast hall of mother-of-pearl filled with beautiful treasures. After passing through sixty rooms, the hands stopped before a comfortable armchair by the fireplace. The fire lit itself, and the hands removed his wet clothes, presenting him with fresh garments embroidered with gold and emeralds. He admired the deftness of the hands, though they startled him at times.\n\nOnce ready, he was led to a dining room where the walls depicted stories of famous cats. The table was set with golden plates and crystal dishes. Suddenly, a dozen cats entered, carrying guitars and rolls of music, creating the strangest music imaginable. The prince laughed at the comical musicians when a tiny figure covered by a long black veil entered, accompanied by two cats in black mantles. The figure revealed itself to be a lovely little white cat, who welcomed him warmly.\n\n\""Lady Cat,\"" the prince said, \""I thank you for your kindness, but you are no ordinary cat. Your speech and the magnificence of your castle prove it.\""\n\n\""King's son,\"" replied the White Cat, \""spare me the compliments. Let supper be served, and silence the musicians, for you do not understand them.\"" \n\nAs supper was served, the prince noticed a bracelet on the White Cat's paw, containing a portrait of a handsome young man who looked just like him. The White Cat sighed, and the prince, fearing to upset her, changed the subject. They conversed about various topics, and after supper, they enjoyed a theatrical performance by the cats. The White Cat bid him goodnight, and the hands led him to a beautifully decorated room where he fell asleep.\n\nThe next morning, he awoke to a commotion outside. The hands dressed him in hunting attire, and he saw all the cats assembled for a hunt. The White Cat rode a monkey, and the prince found the hunting party delightful. After returning to the castle, they dined together again, but when the White Cat offered him a crystal goblet containing a magic draught, he drank it and forgot everything, including his quest for the little dog.\n\nDays passed in happiness until the year was nearly over. The White Cat reminded him he had only three days left to find a dog, and his brothers had already found lovely ones. The prince panicked, realizing the importance of his task. The White Cat reassured him, saying she would help him. She presented him with an acorn, claiming it contained a prettier dog than any he could find.\n\nDelighted, the prince thanked her and prepared to leave. He wished he could take her with him, but she shook her head sadly. He arrived first at the castle where he was to meet his brothers, who soon followed. They were astonished to see the wooden horse he rode. The brothers shared their adventures, but the youngest prince concealed his experiences, leading them to believe a turnspit dog he had was the one for the King.\n\nThe next morning, they presented their dogs to the King. The two eldest had tiny, fragile dogs, while the youngest's turnspit was muddy and unrecognizable. When the King saw the dogs, he could not decide which was prettiest. The youngest prince then revealed the acorn, and when he opened it, a tiny dog emerged, dancing on a white cushion. The King was amazed, unable to deny the beauty of the little creature.\n\nHowever, the King, reluctant to part with his crown, sent his sons on another quest. This time, they were to find a piece of muslin so fine it could pass through the eye of a needle. The two eldest princes agreed to set out again, while the youngest rode back to the White Cat. Upon his arrival, he found the castle even more splendid than before, and the White Cat welcomed him joyfully.\n\nThe prince explained his new quest, and the White Cat, serious now, said she would set the castle's cats to spin the muslin. They enjoyed a delightful supper, and the days passed quickly. When the year was up, the White Cat assured him they had made the muslin well. She presented him with a magnificent chariot drawn by twelve white horses, instructing him to take a walnut that contained the muslin.\n\nThe prince thanked her profusely, but she insisted he must not stay. He set off, arriving at the King's palace in half the time. His brothers, having arrived earlier, displayed their muslin, but the King found it impossible to pass through the eye of a special needle he produced. Just then, the youngest prince arrived, and when he opened the walnut, he found only a hazel-nut, which contained a cherry-stone, then a grain of wheat, and finally a millet seed.\n\nTo his astonishment, the millet seed contained a piece of muslin, beautifully woven and able to pass through the needle's eye with ease. The King, pale with disbelief, realized the youngest prince had succeeded. He then declared that whoever could bring back the loveliest princess would be married and crowned. The prince, feeling he had earned the kingdom fairly, returned to the White Cat, who was expecting him.\n\nShe instructed him to cut off her head to free her from her enchantment. Heartbroken, the prince reluctantly obeyed, and to his amazement, a beautiful princess appeared. The castle filled with joy as knights and ladies entered, congratulating her on her return to her true form. The princess explained her story, revealing she was the daughter of a king and had been cursed by fairies.\n\nThe prince, enchanted by her beauty and kindness, declared his love, and she reciprocated. They returned to the King, who was overjoyed to see his son happy. The princess offered to share her kingdoms with the King and his sons, and the marriage of the three princes was celebrated with great joy. The festivities lasted for months, and they all lived happily ever after."""
80,Thumbelina,"""There was once a woman who wanted to have quite a tiny, little child, but she did not know where to get one from. So one day she went to an old Witch and said to her, \""I should so much like to have a tiny, little child; can you tell me where I can get one?\"" \n\n\""Oh, we have just got one ready!\"" said the Witch. \""Here is a barley-corn for you, but it's not the kind the farmer sows in his field, or feeds the cocks and hens with, I can tell you. Put it in a flower-pot, and then you will see something happen.\"" \n\n\""Oh, thank you!\"" said the woman, and gave the Witch a shilling, for that was what it cost. Then she went home and planted the barley-corn; immediately there grew out of it a large and beautiful flower, which looked like a tulip, but the petals were tightly closed as if it were still only a bud. \n\n\""What a beautiful flower!\"" exclaimed the woman, and she kissed the red and yellow petals; but as she kissed them, the flower burst open. It was a real tulip, such as one can see any day; but in the middle of the blossom, on the green velvety petals, sat a little girl, quite tiny, trim, and pretty. She was scarcely half a thumb in height; so they called her Thumbelina. An elegant polished walnut-shell served Thumbelina as a cradle, the blue petals of a violet were her mattress, and a rose-leaf her coverlid. There she lay at night, but in the daytime she used to play about on the table; here the woman had put a bowl, surrounded by a ring of flowers, with their stalks in water, in the middle of which floated a great tulip petal, and on this Thumbelina sat, and sailed from one side of the bowl to the other, rowing herself with two white horse-hairs for oars. It was such a pretty sight! She could sing, too, with a voice more soft and sweet than had ever been heard before.\n\nOne night, when she was lying in her pretty little bed, an old toad crept in through a broken pane in the window. She was very ugly, clumsy, and clammy; she hopped on to the table where Thumbelina lay asleep under the red rose-leaf. \""This would make a beautiful wife for my son,\"" said the toad, taking up the walnut-shell, with Thumbelina inside, and hopping with it through the window into the garden. \n\nThere flowed a great wide stream, with slippery and marshy banks; here the toad lived with her son. Ugh! how ugly and clammy he was, just like his mother! \""Croak, croak, croak!\"" was all he could say when he saw the pretty little girl in the walnut-shell. \""Don't talk so loud, or you'll wake her,\"" said the old toad. \""She might escape us even now; she is as light as a feather. We will put her at once on a broad water-lily leaf in the stream. That will be quite an island for her; she is so small and light. She can't run away from us there, whilst we are preparing the guest-chamber under the marsh where she shall live.\""\n\nOutside in the brook grew many water-lilies, with broad green leaves, which looked as if they were swimming about on the water. The leaf farthest away was the largest, and to this the old toad swam with Thumbelina in her walnut-shell. The tiny Thumbelina woke up very early in the morning, and when she saw where she was, she began to cry bitterly; for on every side of the great green leaf was water, and she could not get to the land. \n\nThe old toad was down under the marsh, decorating her room with rushes and yellow marigold leaves, to make it very grand for her new daughter-in-law; then she swam out with her ugly son to the leaf where Thumbelina lay. She wanted to fetch the pretty cradle to put it into her room before Thumbelina herself came there. The old toad bowed low in the water before her and said, \""Here is my son; you shall marry him, and live in great magnificence down under the marsh.\"" \n\n\""Croak, croak, croak!\"" was all that the son could say. Then they took the neat little cradle and swam away with it; but Thumbelina sat alone on the great green leaf and wept, for she did not want to live with the clammy toad, or marry her ugly son. The little fishes swimming about under the water had seen the toad quite plainly and heard what she had said; so they put up their heads to see the little girl. When they saw her, they thought her so pretty that they were very sorry she should go down with the ugly toad to live. No; that must not happen. They assembled in the water round the green stalk which supported the leaf on which she was sitting and nibbled the stem in two. Away floated the leaf down the stream, bearing Thumbelina far beyond the reach of the toad.\n\nOn she sailed past several towns, and the little birds sitting in the bushes saw her and sang, \""What a pretty little girl!\"" The leaf floated farther and farther away; thus Thumbelina left her native land. A beautiful little white butterfly fluttered above her, and at last settled on the leaf. Thumbelina pleased him, and she, too, was delighted, for now the toads could not reach her, and it was so beautiful where she was traveling; the sun shone on the water and made it sparkle like the brightest silver. She took off her sash and tied one end round the butterfly; the other end she fastened to the leaf, so that now it glided along with her faster than ever.\n\nA great cockchafer came flying past; he caught sight of Thumbelina, and in a moment had put his arms round her slender waist and had flown off with her to a tree. The green leaf floated away down the stream, and the butterfly with it, for he was fastened to the leaf and could not get loose from it. Oh, dear! how terrified poor little Thumbelina was when the cockchafer flew off with her to the tree! But she was especially distressed on the beautiful white butterfly's account, as she had tied him fast, so that if he could not get away he must starve to death. But the cockchafer did not trouble himself about that; he sat down with her on a large green leaf, gave her the honey out of the flowers to eat, and told her that she was very pretty, although she wasn't in the least like a cockchafer. \n\nLater on, all the other cockchafers who lived in the same tree came to pay calls; they examined Thumbelina closely and remarked, \""Why, she has only two legs! How very miserable!\"" \""She has no feelers!\"" cried another. \""How ugly she is!\"" said all the lady chafers\u2014and yet Thumbelina was really very pretty. The cockchafer who had stolen her knew this very well; but when he heard all the ladies saying she was ugly, he began to think so too, and would not keep her; she might go wherever she liked. So he flew down from the tree with her and put her on a daisy. There she sat and wept, because she was so ugly that the cockchafer would have nothing to do with her; and yet she was the most beautiful creature imaginable, so soft and delicate, like the loveliest rose-leaf.\n\nThe whole summer poor little Thumbelina lived alone in the great wood. She plaited a bed for herself of blades of grass and hung it up under a clover-leaf, so that she was protected from the rain; she gathered honey from the flowers for food and drank the dew on the leaves every morning. Thus the summer and autumn passed, but then came winter\u2014the long, cold winter. All the birds who had sung so sweetly about her had flown away; the trees shed their leaves, the flowers died; the great clover-leaf under which she had lived curled up, and nothing remained of it but the withered stalk. She was terribly cold, for her clothes were ragged, and she herself was so small and thin. Poor little Thumbelina! she would surely be frozen to death. It began to snow, and every snow-flake that fell on her was to her as a whole shovelful thrown on one of us, for we are so big, and she was only an inch high. She wrapped herself round in a dead leaf, but it was torn in the middle and gave her no warmth; she was trembling with cold.\n\nJust outside the wood where she was now living lay a great corn-field. But the corn had been gone a long time; only the dry, bare stubble was left standing in the frozen ground. This made a forest for her to wander about in. All at once she came across the door of a field-mouse, who had a little hole under a corn-stalk. There the mouse lived warm and snug, with a store-room full of corn, a splendid kitchen, and dining-room. Poor little Thumbelina went up to the door and begged for a little piece of barley, for she had not had anything to eat for the last two days. \n\n\""Poor little creature!\"" said the field-mouse, for she was a kind-hearted old thing at the bottom. \""Come into my warm room and have some dinner with me.\"" As Thumbelina pleased her, she said, \""As far as I am concerned you may spend the winter with me; but you must keep my room clean and tidy, and tell me stories, for I like that very much.\"" And Thumbelina did all that the kind old field-mouse asked, and did it remarkably well too.\n\n\""Now I am expecting a visitor,\"" said the field-mouse; \""my neighbour comes to call on me once a week. He is in better circumstances than I am, has great, big rooms, and wears a fine black-velvet coat. If you could only marry him, you would be well provided for. But he is blind. You must tell him all the prettiest stories you know.\"" \n\nBut Thumbelina did not trouble her head about him, for he was only a mole. He came and paid them a visit in his black-velvet coat. \""He is so rich and so accomplished,\"" the field-mouse told her. \""His house is twenty times larger than mine; he possesses great knowledge, but he cannot bear the sun and the beautiful flowers, and speaks slightingly of them, for he has never seen them.\"" \n\nThumbelina had to sing to him, so she sang \""Lady-bird, lady-bird, fly away home!\"" and other songs so prettily that the mole fell in love with her; but he did not say anything, he was a very cautious man. A short time before he had dug a long passage through the ground from his own house to that of his neighbour; in this he gave the field-mouse and Thumbelina permission to walk as often as they liked. But he begged them not to be afraid of the dead bird that lay in the passage: it was a real bird with beak and feathers, and must have died a little time ago, and now laid buried just where he had made his tunnel. The mole took a piece of rotten wood in his mouth, for that glows like fire in the dark, and went in front, lighting them through the long dark passage.\n\nWhen they came to the place where the dead bird lay, the mole put his broad nose against the ceiling and pushed a hole through, so that the daylight could shine down. In the middle of the path lay a dead swallow, his pretty wings pressed close to his sides, his claws and head drawn under his feathers; the poor bird had evidently died of cold. Thumbelina was very sorry, for she was very fond of all little birds; they had sung and twittered so beautifully to her all through the summer. But the mole kicked him with his bandy legs and said, \""Now he can't sing any more! It must be very miserable to be a little bird! I'm thankful that none of my little children are; birds always starve in winter.\"" \n\n\""Yes, you speak like a sensible man,\"" said the field-mouse. \""What has a bird, in spite of all his singing, in the winter-time? He must starve and freeze, and that must be very pleasant for him, I must say!\"" \n\nThumbelina did not say anything; but when the other two had passed on, she bent down to the bird, brushed aside the feathers from his head, and kissed his closed eyes gently. \""Perhaps it was he that sang to me so prettily in the summer,\"" she thought. \""How much pleasure he did give me, dear little bird!\"" \n\nThe mole closed up the hole again which let in the light, and then escorted the ladies home. But Thumbelina could not sleep that night; so she got out of bed, and plaited a great big blanket of straw, and carried it off, and spread it over the dead bird, and piled upon it thistle-down as soft as cotton-wool, which she had found in the field-mouse's room, so that the poor little thing should lie warmly buried. \n\n\""Farewell, pretty little bird!\"" she said. \""Farewell, and thank you for your beautiful songs in the summer, when the trees were green, and the sun shone down warmly on us!\"" Then she laid her head against the bird's heart. But the bird was not dead: he had been frozen, but now that she had warmed him, he was coming to life again. \n\nIn autumn the swallows fly away to foreign lands; but there are some who are late in starting, and then they get so cold that they drop down as if dead, and the snow comes and covers them over. Thumbelina trembled; she was so frightened, for the bird was very large in comparison with herself\u2014only an inch high. But she took courage, piled up the down more closely over the poor swallow, fetched her own coverlid, and laid it over his head. \n\nNext night she crept out again to him. There he was alive, but very weak; he could only open his eyes for a moment and look at Thumbelina, who was standing in front of him with a piece of rotten wood in her hand, for she had no other lantern. \""Thank you, pretty little child!\"" said the swallow to her. \""I am so beautifully warm! Soon I shall regain my strength, and then I shall be able to fly out again into the warm sunshine.\"" \n\n\""Oh!\"" she said, \""it is very cold outside; it is snowing and freezing! Stay in your warm bed; I will take care of you!\"" Then she brought him water in a petal, which he drank, after which he related to her how he had torn one of his wings on a bramble, so that he could not fly as fast as the other swallows, who had flown far away to warmer lands. So at last he had dropped down exhausted, and then he could remember no more. The whole winter he remained down there, and Thumbelina looked after him and nursed him tenderly. Neither the mole nor the field-mouse learnt anything of this, for they could not bear the poor swallow.\n\nWhen the spring came, and the sun warmed the earth again, the swallow said farewell to Thumbelina, who opened the hole in the roof for him which the mole had made. The sun shone brightly down upon her, and the swallow asked her if she would go with him; she could sit upon his back. Thumbelina wanted very much to fly far away into the green wood, but she knew that the old field-mouse would be sad if she ran away. \""No, I mustn't come!\"" she said. \n\n\""Farewell, dear good little girl!\"" said the swallow, and flew off into the sunshine. Thumbelina gazed after him with the tears standing in her eyes, for she was very fond of the swallow. \""Tweet, tweet!\"" sang the bird, and flew into the green wood. Thumbelina was very unhappy. She was not allowed to go out into the warm sunshine. The corn which had been sowed in the field over the field-mouse's home grew up high into the air and made a thick forest for the poor little girl, who was only an inch high.\n\n\""Now you are to be a bride, Thumbelina!\"" said the field-mouse, \""for our neighbour has proposed for you! What a piece of fortune for a poor child like you! Now you must set to work at your linen for your dowry, for nothing must be lacking if you are to become the wife of our neighbour, the mole!\"" \n\nThumbelina had to spin all day long, and every evening the mole visited her and told her that when the summer was over the sun would not shine so hot; now it was burning the earth as hard as a stone. Yes, when the summer had passed, they would keep the wedding. But she was not at all pleased about it, for she did not like the stupid mole. Every morning when the sun was rising, and every evening when it was setting, she would steal out of the house-door, and when the breeze parted the ears of corn so that she could see the blue sky through them, she thought how bright and beautiful it must be outside, and longed to see her dear swallow again. But he never came; no doubt he had flown away far into the great green wood.\n\nBy the autumn, Thumbelina had finished the dowry. \""In four weeks you will be married!\"" said the field-mouse; \""don't be obstinate, or I shall bite you with my sharp white teeth! You will get a fine husband! The King himself has not such a velvet coat. His store-room and cellar are full, and you should be thankful for that.\"" \n\nWell, the wedding-day arrived. The mole had come to fetch Thumbelina to live with him deep down under the ground, never to come out into the warm sun again, for that was what he didn't like. The poor little girl was very sad; for now she must say good-bye to the beautiful sun. \""Farewell, bright sun!\"" she cried, stretching out her arms towards it, and taking another step outside the house; for now the corn had been reaped, and only the dry stubble was left standing. \""Farewell, farewell!\"" she said, and put her arms round a little red flower that grew there. \""Give my love to the dear swallow when you see him!\"" \n\n\""Tweet, tweet!\"" sounded in her ear all at once. She looked up. There was the swallow flying past! As soon as he saw Thumbelina, he was very glad. She told him how unwilling she was to marry the ugly mole, as then she had to live underground where the sun never shone, and she could not help bursting into tears. \n\n\""The cold winter is coming now,\"" said the swallow. \""I must fly away to warmer lands: will you come with me? You can sit on my back, and we will fly far away from the ugly mole and his dark house, over the mountains, to the warm countries where the sun shines more brightly than here, where it is always summer, and there are always beautiful flowers. Do come with me, dear little Thumbelina, who saved my life when I lay frozen in the dark tunnel!\"" \n\n\""Yes, I will go with you,\"" said Thumbelina, and got on the swallow's back, with her feet on one of his outstretched wings. Up he flew into the air, over woods and seas, over the great mountains where the snow is always lying. And if she was cold she crept under his warm feathers, only keeping her little head out to admire all the beautiful things in the world beneath. At last they came to warm lands; there the sun was brighter, the sky seemed twice as high, and in the hedges hung the finest green and purple grapes; in the woods grew oranges and lemons: the air was scented with myrtle and mint, and on the roads were pretty little children running about and playing with great gorgeous butterflies. But the swallow flew on farther, and it became more and more beautiful. Under the most splendid green trees besides a blue lake stood a glittering white-marble castle. Vines hung about the high pillars; there were many swallows' nests, and in one of these lived the swallow who was carrying Thumbelina.\n\n\""Here is my house!\"" said he. \""But it won't do for you to live with me; I am not tidy enough to please you. Find a home for yourself in one of the lovely flowers that grow down there; now I will set you down, and you can do whatever you like.\"" \n\n\""That will be splendid!\"" said she, clapping her little hands. There lay a great white marble column which had fallen to the ground and broken into three pieces, but between these grew the most beautiful white flowers. The swallow flew down with Thumbelina and set her upon one of the broad leaves. But there, to her astonishment, she found a tiny little man sitting in the middle of the flower, as white and transparent as if he were made of glass; he had the prettiest golden crown on his head, and the most beautiful wings on his shoulders; he himself was no bigger than Thumbelina. He was the spirit of the flower. In each blossom there dwelt a tiny man or woman; but this one was the King over the others.\n\n\""How handsome he is!\"" whispered Thumbelina to the swallow. The little Prince was very much frightened at the swallow, for in comparison with one so tiny as himself he seemed a giant. But when he saw Thumbelina, he was delighted, for she was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. So he took his golden crown from off his head and put it on hers, asking her her name, and if she would be his wife, and then she would be Queen of all the flowers. Yes! he was a different kind of husband to the son of the toad and the mole with the black-velvet coat. So she said \""Yes\"" to the noble Prince. And out of each flower came a lady and gentleman, each so tiny and pretty that it was a pleasure to see them. Each brought Thumbelina a present, but the best of all was a beautiful pair of wings which were fastened on to her back, and now she too could fly from flower to flower.\n\nThey all wished her joy, and the swallow sat above in his nest and sang the wedding march, and that he did as well as he could; but he was sad, because he was very fond of Thumbelina and did not want to be separated from her. \n\n\""You shall not be called Thumbelina!\"" said the spirit of the flower to her; \""that is an ugly name, and you are much too pretty for that. We will call you May Blossom.\"" \n\n\""Farewell, farewell!\"" said the little swallow with a heavy heart, and flew away to farther lands, far, far away, right back to Denmark. There he had a little nest above a window, where his wife lived, who can tell fairy-stories. \""Tweet, tweet!\"" he sang to her. And that is the way we learnt the whole story."""
83,Fairy Gifts,"""It generally happens that people's surroundings reflect more or less accurately their minds and dispositions. Perhaps that is why the Flower Fairy lived in a lovely palace, with the most delightful garden you can imagine. It was full of flowers, trees, fountains, fish-ponds, and everything nice. For the Fairy herself was so kind and charming that everybody loved her. All the young princes and princesses who formed her court were as happy as the day was long, simply because they were near her. They came to her when they were quite tiny and never left her until they were grown up and had to go away into the great world. When that time came, she gave to each whatever gift he asked of her. But it is chiefly of the Princess Sylvia that you are going to hear now. The Fairy loved her with all her heart, for she was at once original and gentle.\n\nSylvia had nearly reached the age at which the gifts were generally bestowed. However, the Fairy had a great wish to know how the other princesses who had grown up and left her were prospering. Before the time came for Sylvia to go herself, she resolved to send her to some of them. So one day, her chariot, drawn by butterflies, was made ready, and the Fairy said, \""Sylvia, I am going to send you to the court of Iris. She will receive you with pleasure for my sake as well as for your own. In two months, you may come back to me again, and I shall expect you to tell me what you think of her.\""\n\nSylvia was very unwilling to go away, but as the Fairy wished it, she said nothing. Only when the two months were over did she step joyfully into the butterfly chariot. She could not get back quickly enough to the Flower Fairy, who, for her part, was equally delighted to see her again. \""Now, child,\"" said she, \""tell me what impression you have received.\""\n\n\""You sent me, madam,\"" answered Sylvia, \""to the Court of Iris, on whom you had bestowed the gift of beauty. She never tells anyone, however, that it was your gift, though she often speaks of your kindness in general. It seemed to me that her loveliness, which fairly dazzled me at first, had absolutely deprived her of the use of any of her other gifts or graces. In allowing herself to be seen, she appeared to think that she was doing all that could possibly be required of her. But, unfortunately, while I was still with her, she became seriously ill. Though she presently recovered, her beauty is entirely gone, so that she hates the very sight of herself and is in despair. She entreated me to tell you what had happened and to beg you, in pity, to give her beauty back to her. And, indeed, she does need it terribly, for all the things in her that were tolerable, and even agreeable, when she was so pretty, seem quite different now she is ugly. It is so long since she thought of using her mind or her natural cleverness that I really don't think she has any left now. She is quite aware of all this herself, so you may imagine how unhappy she is, and how earnestly she begs for your aid.\""\n\n\""You have told me what I wanted to know,\"" cried the Fairy, \""but alas! I cannot help her. My gifts can be given but once.\""\n\nSome time passed in all the usual delights of the Flower Fairy's palace, and then she sent for Sylvia again. She told her she was to stay for a little while with the Princess Daphne. Accordingly, the butterflies whisked her off and set her down in quite a strange kingdom. She had only been there a very little time before a wandering butterfly brought a message from her to the Fairy, begging that she might be sent for as soon as possible. Before very long, she was allowed to return.\n\n\""Ah! madam,\"" cried she, \""what a place you sent me to that time!\""\n\n\""Why, what was the matter?\"" asked the Fairy. \""Daphne was one of the princesses who asked for the gift of eloquence, if I remember rightly.\""\n\n\""And very ill the gift of eloquence becomes a woman,\"" replied Sylvia, with an air of conviction. \""It is true that she speaks well, and her expressions are well chosen. But then she never leaves off talking, and though at first one may be amused, one ends by being wearied to death. Above all things, she loves any assembly for settling the affairs of her kingdom. On those occasions, she can talk and talk without fear of interruption. Even then, the moment it is over, she is ready to begin again about anything or nothing, as the case may be. Oh! how glad I was to come away, I cannot tell you.\""\n\nThe Fairy smiled at Sylvia's unfeigned disgust at her late experience. After allowing her a little time to recover, she sent her to the Court of the Princess Cynthia, where she left her for three months. At the end of that time, Sylvia came back to her with all the joy and contentment that one feels at being once more beside a dear friend. The Fairy, as usual, was anxious to hear what she thought of Cynthia, who had always been amiable, and to whom she had given the gift of pleasing.\n\n\""I thought at first,\"" said Sylvia, \""that she must be the happiest Princess in the world. She had a thousand lovers who vied with one another in their efforts to please and gratify her. Indeed, I had nearly decided that I would ask a similar gift.\""\n\n\""Have you altered your mind, then?\"" interrupted the Fairy.\n\n\""Yes, indeed, madam,\"" replied Sylvia, \""and I will tell you why. The longer I stayed, the more I saw that Cynthia was not really happy. In her desire to please everyone, she ceased to be sincere and degenerated into a mere coquette. Even her lovers felt that the charms and fascinations which were exercised upon all who approached her without distinction were valueless, so that in the end they ceased to care for them and went away disdainfully.\""\n\n\""I am pleased with you, child,\"" said the Fairy; \""enjoy yourself here for awhile, and presently you shall go to Phyllida.\""\n\nSylvia was glad to have leisure to think, for she could not make up her mind at all what she should ask for herself, and the time was drawing very near. However, before very long, the Fairy sent her to Phyllida and waited for her report with unabated interest.\n\n\""I reached her court safely,\"" said Sylvia, \""and she received me with much kindness, and immediately began to exercise upon me that brilliant wit which you had bestowed upon her. I confess that I was fascinated by it, and for a week thought that nothing could be more desirable. The time passed like magic, so great was the charm of her society. But I ended by ceasing to covet that gift more than any of the others I have seen, for, like the gift of pleasing, it cannot really give satisfaction. By degrees, I wearied of what had so delighted me at first, especially as I perceived more and more plainly that it is impossible to be constantly smart and amusing without being frequently ill-natured, and too apt to turn all things, even the most serious, into mere occasions for a brilliant jest.\""\n\nThe Fairy in her heart agreed with Sylvia's conclusions and felt pleased with herself for having brought her up so well.\n\nBut now the time was come for Sylvia to receive her gift, and all her companions were assembled. The Fairy stood in the midst and in the usual manner asked what she would take with her into the great world.\n\nSylvia paused for a moment and then answered, \""A quiet spirit.\"" And the Fairy granted her request.\n\nThis lovely gift makes life a constant happiness to its possessor and to all who are brought into contact with her. She has all the beauty of gentleness and contentment in her sweet face. If at times it seems less lovely through some chance grief or disquietude, the hardest thing that one ever hears said is: \""Sylvia's dear face is pale today. It grieves one to see her so.\"" And when, on the contrary, she is gay and joyful, the sunshine of her presence rejoices all who have the happiness of being near her."""
90,Mother Hulda,"""A widow had two daughters; one was pretty and industrious, while the other was ugly and lazy. The widow favored her ugly daughter, making the pretty one do all the work and be the drudge of the house. Every day, the poor girl had to sit by a well on the high road and spin until her fingers bled. One day, as the spindle was bloody, she dipped it into the well to wash it, but it slipped from her hand and fell in. Distressed, she ran to her stepmother to tell her of the misfortune, but instead of sympathy, she was met with scorn. Her stepmother angrily commanded her, \""As you have let the spindle fall in, you must go and fetch it out again!\""\n\nDesperate and unsure of what to do, the girl returned to the well. In her despair, she jumped into the well, following the spindle. When she regained consciousness, she found herself in a beautiful meadow, with sunlight shining on the flowers around her. As she walked through the meadow, she came upon a baker's oven filled with bread. The bread cried out, \""Oh, take me out, take me out, or I shall burn; I am baked enough already!\"" The girl approached and used the baker's peel to take out all the loaves one by one. Continuing her journey, she encountered a tree laden with ripe apples, which called out, \""Oh, shake me, shake me, we apples are all of us ripe!\"" She shook the tree until the apples fell like rain and gathered them into a heap.\n\nEventually, she arrived at a little house where an old woman with large teeth peered out. Terrified, the girl was about to run away, but the old woman called her back. \""What are you afraid of, my dear child? Come and live with me, and if you do the housework well and orderly, things shall go well with you. You must take great pains to make my bed well, and shake it up thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about, for I am Mother Hulda.\"" Encouraged by the old woman's kind words, the girl agreed and began her work. She diligently fulfilled her tasks, shaking the bed with such vigor that the feathers flew about like snowflakes. She lived a good life, enjoying delicious meals every day.\n\nAfter a long time with Mother Hulda, the girl began to feel sad and realized she was homesick. Despite being better off than at home, she longed to return. Finally, she expressed her feelings to Mother Hulda, who replied, \""It pleases me well that you should wish to go home, and as you have served me faithfully, I will undertake to send you there!\"" Mother Hulda took her by the hand and led her to a large open door. As she passed through, a heavy shower of gold fell upon her, covering her completely. \""All this is yours because you have been so industrious,\"" said Mother Hulda, returning the spindle she had dropped in the well. The girl found herself back in the world, not far from her mother's house. As she passed through the yard, the cock crowed, \""Cock-a-doodle doo! Our golden girl has come home too!\"" She was warmly welcomed by her mother.\n\nThe girl recounted her adventures, and upon hearing of her good fortune, the mother wished for her ugly and lazy daughter to have the same luck. She sent her daughter to sit by the well and spin, and to make her spindle bloody, she forced her to put her hand into a thorn hedge. The lazy girl then threw the spindle into the well and jumped in after it. Like her sister, she found herself in the beautiful meadow and followed the same path. When she reached the baker's oven, the bread cried out, \""Oh, take me out, take me out, or I shall burn; I am quite done already!\"" But the lazy girl replied, \""I have no desire to black my hands,\"" and continued on her way.\n\nNext, she came to the apple tree, which called out, \""Oh, shake me, shake me, we apples are all of us ripe!\"" The lazy girl dismissed it, saying, \""That is all very fine; suppose one of you should fall on my head,\"" and moved on. When she arrived at Mother Hulda's house, she was not afraid, having heard about the old woman's great teeth. She entered into service but quickly became lazy. The first day she worked hard, but by the second day, she was already slacking off, and by the third day, she refused to get up in the morning. She neglected to make Mother Hulda's bed properly, failing to shake it for the feathers to fly about. Mother Hulda soon grew tired of her laziness and gave her warning, which the girl welcomed, thinking the shower of gold was coming.\n\nHowever, instead of gold, Mother Hulda led her to the door and emptied a great kettle full of pitch over her. \""That is the reward for your service,\"" said Mother Hulda, shutting the door behind her. The lazy girl returned home, covered in pitch, and the cock on the well crowed, \""Cock-a-doodle doo! Our dirty girl has come home too!\"" The pitch stuck to her for the rest of her life, and she could never wash it off."""
92,The Straw The Coal And The Bean,"""There lived in a certain village a poor old woman who had collected a mess of beans and was going to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth. In order to make it burn better, she put in a handful of straw. When the beans began to bubble in the pot, one of them fell out and lay, never noticed, near a straw which was already there. Soon a red-hot coal jumped out of the fire and joined the pair.\n\nThe straw began first and said, \""Dear friends, how do you come here?\"" The coal answered, \""I jumped out of the fire by great good luck, or I should certainly have met with my death. I should have been burned to ashes.\"" The bean said, \""I too have come out of it with a whole skin. If the old woman had kept me in the pot, I should have been cooked into a soft mass like my comrades.\"" The straw added, \""Nor should I have met with a better fate. The old woman has turned my brothers into fire and smoke; sixty of them she took up at once and deprived of life. Very luckily, I managed to slip through her fingers.\""\n\n\""What had we better do now?\"" said the coal. \""I think,\"" answered the bean, \""that as we have been so lucky as to escape with our lives, we will join in good fellowship together. Lest any more bad fortune should happen to us here, we will go abroad into foreign lands.\"" The proposal pleased the two others, and forthwith they started on their travels.\n\nSoon they came to a little brook, and as there was no stepping-stone and no bridge, they could not tell how they were to get to the other side. The straw was struck with a good idea and said, \""I will lay myself across, so that you can go over me as if I were a bridge!\"" So the straw stretched himself from one bank to the other, and the coal, who was of an ardent nature, quickly trotted up to go over the new-made bridge. However, when she reached the middle and heard the water rushing past beneath her, she was struck with terror, stopped, and could get no farther.\n\nAs a result, the straw began to get burnt, broke in two pieces, and fell into the brook. The coal slipped down, hissing as she touched the water, and gave up the ghost. The bean, who had prudently remained behind on the bank, could not help laughing at the sight. Not being able to contain herself, she went on laughing so excessively that she burst. \n\nNow, she would certainly have been undone forever if a tailor on his travels had not by good luck stopped to rest himself by the brook. As he had a compassionate heart, he took out needle and thread and stitched her together again. The bean thanked him in the most elegant manner, but as he had sewn her up with black stitches, all beans since then have a black seam."""
97,King O Toole And St Kevin,"""There was once a king, called King O'Toole, who was a fine old king in the ancient times, long ago. It was he who owned the Churches in the early days. \""Surely,\"" said I, \""the Churches were not in King O'Toole's time?\"" \""Oh, by no means, your honor\u2014truth, it's yourself that's right enough there. But you know the place is called 'The Churches' because they were built after by St. Kavin, and went by the name of the Churches ever more. Therefore, of course, the place bein' so called, I say that the King owned the Churches\u2014and why not, sir, seein' it was his birthright, time out o' mind, beyond the flood?\""\n\nWell, the King (you see) was the right sort\u2014he was the real boy, and loved sport as he loved his life, and huntin' in particular. From the risin' o' the sun up he got, and away he went over the mountains beyond after the deer: and the fine times them were. The deer was as plenty thin, aye truth, far more plentiful than the sheep is now. That's the way it was with the King, from the crow o' the cock to the song o' the redbreast.\n\nAll went well as long as the King had his health. But, you see, in coorse o' time, the King grew old, by reason he was stiff in his limbs, and when he got stricken in years, his heart failed him. He was lost entirely for want o' diversions because he couldn't go a-huntin' no longer. By dad, the poor King was obliged at last to get a goose to distract him. You see, the goose used to swim across the lake, dive for trout (and not finer trout in all Ireland than the same trout), and catch fish on a Friday for the King. It flew every other day round about the lake, distracting the poor King that you'd think he'd break his sides laughin' at the frolicksome tricks of his goose. So, in course o' time, the goose was the greatest pet in the country, and the biggest rogue, and distracted the King to no end. The poor King was as happy as the day was long.\n\nHowever, all went on mighty well until, by dad, the goose got stricken in years, as well as the King, and grew stiff in the limbs, like her master, and couldn't distract him no longer. Then it was that the poor King was lost completely and didn't know what in the wide world to do. He was gone out of all distractions because the goose was no more in the flower of her bloom.\n\nThe King was nigh broken-hearted and melancholy entirely, and was walkin' one mornin' by the edge of the lake, lamentin' his cruel fate, and thinkin' o' drownin' himself, that could get no diversion in life, when all of a sudden, turnin' round the corner beyond, who should he meet but a mighty decent young man comin' up to him. \""God save you,\"" says the King (for the King was a civil-spoken gentleman, by all accounts), \""God save you,\"" says he to the young man. \n\n\""God save you kindly,\"" says the young man to him back again. \""God save you, King O'Toole.\"" \""True for you,\"" says the King, \""I am King O'Toole,\"" says he. \""Prince and plennypennytinchery o' these parts,\"" says he. \""But how came you to know that?\"" says he. \""Oh, never mind,\"" says Saint Kavin (for 'twas he that was in it). \""And now, may I make bold to ask, how is your goose, King O'Toole?\"" says he. \""Blur-an-agers, how came you to know about my goose?\"" says the King. \""Oh, no matter. I was given to understand it,\"" says Saint Kavin.\n\n\""Oh, that's a folly to talk,\"" says the King, \""because myself and my goose is private friends,\"" says he, \""and no one could tell you,\"" says he, \""barrin' the fairies.\"" \""Oh, then, it wasn't the fairies,\"" says Saint Kavin. \""For I'd have you know,\"" says he, \""that I don't keep the likes o' such company.\"" \""You might do worse, then, my gay fellow,\"" says the King. \""For it's they could show you a crock o' money as easy as kiss hand. And that's not to be sneezed at,\"" says the King, \""by a poor man,\"" says he. \n\n\""Maybe I've a better way of making money myself,\"" says the saint. \""By gor,\"" says the King, \""barrin' you're a coiner,\"" says he, \""that's impossible!\"" \""I'd scorn to be the like, my lord!\"" says Saint Kavin, mighty high, \""I'd scorn to be the like,\"" says he. \""Then, what are you?\"" says the King, \""that makes money so easy, by your own account.\"" \""I'm an honest man,\"" says Saint Kavin. \""Well, honest man,\"" says the King, \""and how is it you make your money so easy?\"" \""By makin' old things as good as new,\"" says Saint Kavin.\n\n\""Is it a tinker you are?\"" says the King. \""No,\"" says the saint; \""I'm no tinker by trade, King O'Toole. I've a better trade than a tinker,\"" says he. \""What would you say,\"" says he, \""if I made your old goose as good as new?\"" \""My dear, at the word o' making his goose as good as new, you'd think the poor old King's eyes was ready to jump out of his head.\"" \""And,\"" says he\u2014\""truth, then, I'd give you more money nor you could count,\"" says he, \""if you did the like, and I'd be beholden to you in the bargain.\""\n\n\""I scorn your dirty money,\"" says Saint Kavin. \""Faith, then, I'm thinkin' a trifle o' change would do you no harm,\"" says the King, lookin' up sly at the old hat that Saint Kavin had on him. \""I have a vow agin it,\"" says the saint. \""I am book sworn,\"" says he, \""never to have gold, silver, or brass in my company.\"" \""Barrin' the trifle you can't help,\"" says the King, mighty cute, and looking him straight in the face. \""You just hot it,\"" says Saint Kavin. \""But though I can't take money,\"" says he, \""I could take a few acres o' land, if you'd give them to me.\""\n\n\""With all the veins o' my heart,\"" says the King, \""if you can do what you say.\"" \""Try me!\"" says Saint Kavin. \""Call down your goose here,\"" says he, \""and I'll see what I can do for her.\"" With that the King whistled, and down came the poor goose, all as one as a hound, waddlin' up to the poor old cripple, her master, and as like him as two peas. The minute the saint set his eyes on the goose, \""I'll do the job for you,\"" says he, \""King O'Toole!\"" \n\n\""By Jaminee,\"" says King O'Toole, \""if you do, but I'll say you're the cleverest fellow in the seven parishes.\"" \""Oh, by dad,\"" says Saint Kavin, \""you must say more nor that\u2014my horn's not so soft all out,\"" says he, \""as to repair your old goose for nothin'. What'll you give me if I do the job for you?\u2014that's the chat,\"" says Saint Kavin. \""I'll give you whatever you ask,\"" says the King. \""Isn't that fair?\"" \""Devil a fairer,\"" says the saint. \""That's the way to do business. Now,\"" says he, \""this is the bargain I'll make with you, King O'Toole: will you give me all the ground the goose flies over, the first offer, after I make her as good as new?\""\n\n\""I will,\"" says the King. \""You won't go back o' your word?\"" says Saint Kavin. \""Honor bright!\"" says King O'Toole, holdin' out his fist. \""Honor bright,\"" says Saint Kavin back again, \""it's a bargain,\"" says he. \""Come here!\"" says he to the poor old goose\u2014\""come here, you unfortunate old cripple,\"" says he, \""and it's I that'll make you the sportin' bird.\"" \n\nWith that, my dear, he took up the goose by the two wings\u2014criss o' my cross an you,\"" says he, markin' her to grace with the blessed sign at the same minute. And throwin' her up in the air, \""whew!\"" says he, just givin' her a blast to help her. With that, my jewel, she took to her heels, flyin' like one o' the eagles themselves, and cuttin' as many capers as a swallow before a shower of rain. Away she went down there, right in front of you, along the side o' the cliff, and flew over Saint Kavin's bed (that is, where Saint Kavin's bed is now, but was not then, by reason as it wasn't made, but was contrived after by Saint Kavin himself, that the women might leave him alone). \n\nAnd on with her under Lugduff, and round the end of the lake there, far beyond where you see the waterfall. And on with her then right over the lead mines o' Luganure (that is, where the lead mines is now, but was not then, by reason they weren't discovered, but was all gold in Saint Kavin's time). Well, over the end o' Luganure she flew, stout and studdy, and round the other end of the little lake, by the Churches (that is, of course, where the Churches is now, but was not then, by reason they were not built, but afterwards by Saint Kavin), and over the big hill here over your head, where you see the big cliff\u2014(and that cliff in the mountain was made by Finn Ma Cool, where he cut it across with a big sword that he got made a purpose by a blacksmith out o' Rathdrum, a cousin of his own, for to fight a giant that dared him an' the Curragh o' Kildare. He tried the sword first an the mountain, and cut it down into a gap, as is plain to this day. Faith, sure enough, it's the same sauce he served the giant, soon and sudden, and chopped him in two like a potato, for the glory of his soul and old Ireland)\u2014well, down she flew over the cliff, and flutterin' over the wood there at Poulanass.\n\nWell\u2014as I said\u2014afther flutterin' over the wood a little bit, to plaze herself, the goose flew down, and bit at the foot o' the King, as fresh as a daisy, after flyin' round his dominions, just as if she hadn't flew three perch. \""Well, my dear, it was a beautiful sight to see the King standin' with his mouth open, lookin' at his poor old goose flyin' as light as a lark, and better nor ever she was. When she let at his foot he patted her on the head, and ma vourneen,\"" says he, \""but you are the darling o' the world.\""\n\n\""And what do you say to me,\"" says Saint Kavin, \""for makin' her the like?\"" \""By gor,\"" says the King, \""I say nothin' about the art o' men, barrin' the bees.\"" \""And do you say no more nor that?\"" says Saint Kavin. \""And that I'm beholden to you,\"" says the King. \""But will you give me all the ground the goose flew over?\"" says Saint Kavin. \""I will,\"" says King O'Toole, \""and you're welcome to it,\"" says he, \""though it's the last acre I have to give.\""\n\n\""But you'll keep your word true?\"" says the saint. \""As true as the sun,\"" says the King. \""It's well for you,\"" says Saint Kavin, mighty sharp\u2014\""it's well for you, King O'Toole, that you said that word,\"" says he. \""For if you didn't say that word, the devil receive the bit o' your goose id ever fly again,\"" says Saint Kavin. \""Oh, you needn't laugh,\"" said old Joe, \""for it's truth I'm telling you.\""\n\nWell, when the King was as good as his word, Saint Kavin was pleased with him, and then it was that he made himself known to the King. \""Well, my dear, that's the way that the place came, all at once, into the hands of Saint Kavin. The goose flew round every individual acre o' King O'Toole's property, you see, bein' let into the secret by Saint Kavin, who was mighty cute. So, when he done the old King out of his property for the glory of God, he was pleased with him. He and the King was the best o' friends ever more after (for the poor old King was doatin', you see), and the King had his goose as good as new to distract him as long as he lived. \n\nThe saint supported him after he came into his property, as I told you, until the day of his death\u2014and that was soon afther. The poor goose thought he was catchin' a trout one Friday. But, my jewel, it was a mistake he made\u2014and instead of a trout, it was a thievin' horse-eel! And, by gor, instead of the goose killin' a trout for the King's supper\u2014by dad, the eel killed the King's goose\u2014and small blame to him. But he didn't ate her, because he doesn't eat what Saint Kavin laid his blessed hands on."""
