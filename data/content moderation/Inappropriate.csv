4,Goblin Huckster,"""There was once a regular student who lived in a garret and had no possessions. Below him, on the ground floor, resided a huckster, who owned the house. The huckster was accompanied by a goblin, who stayed with him because, at Christmas, the huckster always had a large dishful of jam with a great piece of butter in the middle. The huckster could afford this, and therefore the goblin remained with him, which was very shrewd of the goblin.\n\nOne evening, the student entered the shop through the back door to buy candles and cheese for himself, as he had no one to send. After obtaining what he wished, the huckster and his wife nodded good evening to him. The huckster's wife was a woman who could do more than merely nod; she usually had plenty to say for herself. The student nodded as he turned to leave but suddenly stopped to read the piece of paper in which the cheese was wrapped. It was a leaf torn out of an old book, a book that ought not to have been torn up, for it was full of poetry.\n\n\""Yonder lies some more of the same sort,\"" said the huckster. \""I gave an old woman a few coffee berries for it; you shall have the rest for sixpence if you will.\"" \""Indeed I will,\"" replied the student. \""Give me the book instead of the cheese; I can eat my bread and butter without cheese. It would be a sin to tear up a book like this. You are a clever man and a practical man, but you understand no more about poetry than that cask yonder.\"" This was a very rude speech, especially against the cask, but both the huckster and the student laughed, as it was said in jest. However, the goblin felt very angry that anyone should dare to speak such things to a huckster who was a householder and sold the best butter.\n\nAs soon as night fell and the shop closed, everyone went to bed except the student. The goblin stepped softly into the bedroom where the huckster's wife slept and took away her tongue, which she did not need at that moment. Whatever object in the room he placed this tongue upon immediately received voice and speech, able to express its thoughts and feelings as readily as the lady herself could do. The goblin laid the tongue upon the cask, which contained a quantity of old newspapers.\n\n\""Is it really true,\"" he asked, \""that you do not know what poetry is?\"" \""Of course I know,\"" replied the cask. \""Poetry is something that always stands in the corner of a newspaper and is sometimes cut out. And I may venture to affirm that I have more of it in me than the student has, even if I am only a poor tub of the huckster's.\"" The goblin then placed the tongue on the coffee mill, and it began to chatter away. He put it on the butter-tub and the cash-box, and they all expressed the same opinion as the waste-paper tub. A majority must always be respected. \""Now I shall go and tell the student,\"" said the goblin.\n\nWith these words, he quietly ascended the back stairs to the garret where the student lived. The student's candle was still burning, and the goblin peeped through the keyhole, seeing the student reading in the torn book he had bought from the shop. The room was filled with a radiant light that shot forth from the book, growing broad and full like the stem of a tree, with bright rays spreading upward and over the student's head. Each leaf was fresh, and each flower resembled a beautiful female head\u2014some with dark, sparkling eyes and others with wonderfully blue and clear eyes. The fruit gleamed like stars, and the room was filled with the sounds of beautiful music. The little goblin had never imagined, much less seen or heard of, any sight so glorious as this. He stood still on tiptoe, peeping in until the light went out. The student had likely blown out his candle and gone to bed, but the little goblin remained, listening to the soft, beautiful music\u2014a sweet cradle song for the student who had lain down to rest.\n\n\""This is a wonderful place,\"" said the goblin; \""I never expected such a thing. I should like to stay here with the student.\"" However, he was a sensible sprite and thought it over. At last, he sighed, \""But the student has no jam!\"" So he went back downstairs to the huckster's shop, and it was fortunate he did, for the cask had almost worn out the lady's tongue. The cask had given a description of all that it contained on one side and was just about to turn over to describe what was on the other side when the goblin entered and restored the tongue to the lady. From that time forward, the whole shop, from the cash-box down to the pine-wood logs, formed their opinions based on that of the cask. They all had such confidence in him and treated him with so much respect that when, in the evening, the huckster read the criticisms on theatricals and art, they fancied it must all come from the cask.\n\nAfter what he had seen, the goblin could no longer sit and listen quietly to the wisdom and understanding downstairs. As soon as the evening light glimmered in the garret, he took courage, feeling that the rays of light were strong cables drawing him up, obliging him to peep through the keyhole. While there, a feeling of vastness came over him, akin to what we experience by the ever-moving sea when a storm breaks forth, bringing tears to his eyes. He did not know why he wept, yet a kind of pleasant feeling mingled with his tears. \""How wonderfully glorious it would be to sit with the student under such a tree!\"" But that was out of the question; he must be content to look through the keyhole and be thankful for even that.\n\nThere he stood on the cold landing, with the autumn wind blowing down upon him through the trapdoor. It was very cold, but the little creature did not truly feel it until the light in the garret went out and the tones of music faded away. Then he shivered and crept downstairs again to his warm corner, where he felt at home and comfortable. When Christmas came again, bringing the dish of jam and the great lump of butter, he liked the huckster best of all.\n\nSoon after, the goblin was awakened in the middle of the night by a terrible noise and knocking against the window shutters and house doors, accompanied by the sound of the watchman's horn. A great fire had broken out, and the whole street seemed full of flames. Was it in their house or a neighbor's? No one could tell, for terror had seized upon all. The huckster's wife was so bewildered that she took her gold earrings out of her ears and put them in her pocket to save something. The huckster ran to get his business papers, while the servant resolved to save her black silk mantle, which she had managed to buy. All wished to keep the best things they had. The goblin shared this wish, for with one spring, he was upstairs in the student's room. He found the student standing by the open window, calmly looking at the fire raging in the house of a neighbor opposite.\n\nThe goblin quickly grabbed the wonderful book that lay on the table and tucked it into his red cap, which he held tightly with both hands. The greatest treasure in the house was saved, and he ran away with it to the roof, seating himself on the chimney. The flames of the burning house opposite illuminated him as he sat with both hands pressed tightly over his cap, in which the treasure lay. It was then that he understood what feelings were truly strongest in his heart and knew exactly which way they tended. Yet, when the fire was extinguished and the goblin began to reflect, he hesitated and finally said, \""I must divide myself between the two; I cannot quite give up the huckster because of the jam.\"" This is a representation of human nature. We are like the goblin; we all go to visit the huckster, \""because of the jam.\"""""
6,Old Street Lamp,"""Did you ever hear the story of the old street lamp? It is not remarkably interesting, but for once you may as well listen to it. It was a most respectable old lamp, which had seen many, many years of service and now was to retire with a pension. It was this very evening at its post for the last time, giving light to the street. Its feelings were something like those of an old dancer at the theater who is dancing for the last time and knows that on the morrow she will be in her garret, alone and forgotten.\n\nThe lamp had very great anxiety about the next day, for it knew that it had to appear for the first time at the town hall to be inspected by the mayor and the council, who were to decide whether it was fit for further service; whether it was good enough to be used to light the inhabitants of one of the suburbs, or in the country, at some factory. If the lamp could not be used for one of these purposes, it would be sent at once to an iron foundry to be melted down. In this latter case, it might be turned into anything, and it wondered very much whether it would then be able to remember that it had once been a street lamp. This troubled it exceedingly.\n\nWhatever might happen, it seemed certain that the lamp would be separated from the watchman and his wife, whose family it looked upon as its own. The lamp had first been hung up on the very evening that the watchman, then a robust young man, had entered upon the duties of his office. Ah, well! it was a very long time since one became a lamp and the other a watchman. His wife had some little pride in those days; she condescended to glance at the lamp only when she passed by in the evening\u2014never in the daytime. But in later years, when all of them\u2014the watchman, the wife, and the lamp\u2014had grown old, she had attended to it, cleaning it and keeping it supplied with oil. The old people were thoroughly honest; they had never cheated the lamp of a single drop of the oil provided for it.\n\nThis was the lamp's last night in the street, and tomorrow it must go to the town hall\u2014two very dark things to think of. No wonder it did not burn brightly. How many persons it had lighted on their way, and how much it had seen! As much, very likely, as the mayor and corporation themselves! None of these thoughts were uttered aloud, however, for the lamp was good and honorable and would not willingly do harm to anyone, especially to those in authority. As one thing after another was recalled to its mind, the light would flash up with sudden brightness. At such moments, the lamp had a conviction that it would be remembered.\n\n\""There was a handsome young man, once,\"" thought the lamp; \""it is certainly a long while ago, but I remember that he had a little note, written on pink paper with a gold edge. The writing was elegant, evidently a lady's. Twice he read it through, and kissed it, and then looked up at me with eyes that said quite plainly, 'I am the happiest of men!' Only he and I know what was written on this, his first letter from his lady-love. Ah, yes, and there was another pair of eyes that I remember; it is really wonderful how the thoughts jump from one thing to another! A funeral passed through the street. A young and beautiful woman lay on a bier decked with garlands of flowers, and attended by torches which quite overpowered my light. All along the street stood the people from the houses, in crowds, ready to join the procession. But when the torches had passed from before me and I could look around, I saw one person standing alone, leaning against my post and weeping. Never shall I forget the sorrowful eyes that looked up at me.\""\n\nThese and similar reflections occupied the old street lamp on this the last time that its light would shine. The sentry, when he is relieved from his post, knows, at least, who will be his successor, and may whisper a few words to him. But the lamp did not know its successor, or it might have given him a few hints respecting rain or mist and might have informed him how far the moon's rays would reach, and from which side the wind generally blew, and so on.\n\nOn the bridge over the canal stood three persons who wished to recommend themselves to the lamp, for they thought it could give the office to whomsoever it chose. The first was a herring's head, which could emit light in the darkness. He remarked that it would be a great saving of oil if they placed him on the lamp-post. Number two was a piece of rotten wood, which also shines in the dark. He considered himself descended from an old stem, once the pride of the forest. The third was a glowworm, and how he found his way there the lamp could not imagine; yet there he was, and could really give light as well as the others. But the rotten wood and the herring's head declared most solemnly, by all they held sacred, that the glowworm only gave light at certain times and must not be allowed to compete with them. The old lamp assured them that not one of them could give sufficient light to fill the position of a street lamp, but they would believe nothing that it said. When they discovered that it had not the power of naming its successor, they said they were very glad to hear it, for the lamp was too old and worn out to make a proper choice.\n\nAt this moment, the wind came rushing round the corner of the street and through the air-holes of the old lamp. \""What is this I hear?\"" it asked. \""Are you going away tomorrow? Is this evening the last time we shall meet? Then I must present you with a farewell gift. I will blow into your brain, so that in future not only shall you be able to remember all that you have seen or heard in the past, but your light within shall be so bright that you will be able to understand all that is said or done in your presence.\"" \""Oh, that is really a very, very great gift,\"" said the old lamp. \""I thank you most heartily. I only hope I shall not be melted down.\"" \""That is not likely to happen yet,\"" said the wind. \""I will also blow a memory into you, so that, should you receive other similar presents, your old age will pass very pleasantly.\"" \""That is, if I am not melted down,\"" said the lamp. \""But should I, in that case, still retain my memory?\"" \""Do be reasonable, old lamp,\"" said the wind, puffing away.\n\nAt this moment, the moon burst forth from the clouds. \""What will you give the old lamp?\"" asked the wind. \""I can give nothing,\"" she replied. \""I am on the wane, and no lamps have ever given me light, while I have frequently shone upon them.\"" With these words, the moon hid herself again behind the clouds, that she might be saved from further importunities. Just then a drop fell upon the lamp from the roof of the house, but the drop explained that it was a gift from those gray clouds and perhaps the best of all gifts. \""I shall penetrate you so thoroughly,\"" it said, \""that you will have the power of becoming rusty, and, if you wish it, can crumble into dust in one night.\"" But this seemed to the lamp a very shabby present, and the wind thought so, too. \""Does no one give any more? Will no one give any more?\"" shouted the breath of the wind, as loud as it could. Then a bright, falling star came down, leaving a broad, luminous streak behind it.\n\n\""What was that?\"" cried the herring's head. \""Did not a star fall? I really believe it went into the lamp. Certainly, when such high-born personages try for the office we may as well go home.\"" And so they did, all three, while the old lamp threw a wonderfully strong light all around.\n\n\""This is a glorious gift,\"" it said. \""The bright stars have always been a joy to me and have always shone more brilliantly than I ever could shine, though I have tried with my whole might. Now they have noticed me, a poor old lamp, and have sent me a gift that will enable me to see clearly everything that I remember, as if it still stood before me, and to let it be seen by all those who love me. And herein lies the truest happiness, for pleasures which we cannot share with others are only half enjoyed.\""\n\n\""That sentiment does you honor,\"" said the wind; \""but for this purpose, wax lights will be necessary. If these are not lighted in you, your peculiar faculties will not benefit others in the least. The stars have not thought of this. They suppose that you and every other light must be a wax taper. But I must go down now.\"" So it laid itself to rest.\n\n\""Wax tapers, indeed!\"" said the lamp; \""I have never yet had these, nor is it likely I ever shall. If I could only be sure of not being melted down!\""\n\nThe next day\u2014well, perhaps we had better pass over the next day. The evening had come, and the lamp was resting in a grandfather's chair; and guess where! Why, at the old watchman's house. He had begged as a favor that the mayor and corporation would allow him to keep the street lamp in consideration of his long and faithful service, as he had himself hung it up and lighted it on the day he first commenced his duties, four and twenty years ago. He looked upon it almost as his own child. He had no children, so the lamp was given to him.\n\nThere lay the lamp in the great armchair near the warm stove. It seemed almost to have grown larger, for it appeared quite to fill the chair. The old people sat at their supper, casting friendly glances at it, and would willingly have admitted it to a place at the table. It is quite true that they dwelt in a cellar two yards below ground and had to cross a stone passage to get to their room. But within, it was warm and comfortable, and strips of list had been nailed round the door. The bed and the little window had curtains, and everything looked clean and neat. On the window seat stood two curious flowerpots, which a sailor named Christian had brought from the East or West Indies. They were of clay and in the form of two elephants with open backs; they were filled with earth, and through the open space, flowers bloomed. In one grew some very fine chives or leeks; this was the kitchen garden. The other, which contained a beautiful geranium, they called their flower garden.\n\nOn the wall hung a large colored print, representing the Congress of Vienna and all the kings and emperors. A clock with heavy weights hung on the wall and went \""tick, tick,\"" steadily enough; yet it was always rather too fast, which, however, the old people said was better than being too slow. They were now eating their supper, while the old street lamp, as we have heard, lay in the grandfather's armchair near the stove.\n\nIt seemed to the lamp as if the whole world had turned round. But after a while, the old watchman looked at the lamp and spoke of what they had both gone through together\u2014in rain and in fog, during the short, bright nights of summer or in the long winter nights, through the drifting snowstorms when he longed to be at home in the cellar. Then the lamp felt that all was well again. It saw everything that had happened quite clearly, as if the events were passing before it. Surely the wind had given it an excellent gift!\n\nThe old people were very active and industrious; they were never idle for even a single hour. On Sunday afternoons, they would bring out some books, generally a book of travels which they greatly liked. The old man would read aloud about Africa, with its great forests and the wild elephants, while his wife would listen attentively, stealing a glance now and then at the clay elephants which served as flowerpots. \""I can almost imagine I am seeing it all,\"" she said. Ah! how the lamp wished for a wax taper to be lighted in it, for then the old woman would have seen the smallest detail as clearly as it did itself; the lofty trees, with their thickly entwined branches, the naked negroes on horseback, and whole herds of elephants treading down bamboo thickets with their broad, heavy feet.\n\n\""What is the use of all my capabilities,\"" sighed the old lamp, \""when I cannot obtain any wax lights? They have only oil and tallow here, and these will not do.\"" One day a great heap of wax-candle ends found their way into the cellar. The larger pieces were burned, and the smaller ones the old woman kept for waxing her thread. So there were now candles enough, but it never occurred to anyone to put a little piece in the lamp. \""Here I am now, with my rare powers,\"" thought the lamp. \""I have faculties within me, but I cannot share them. They do not know that I could cover these white walls with beautiful tapestry, or change them into noble forests or, indeed, to anything else they might wish.\""\n\nThe lamp, however, was always kept clean and shining in a corner, where it attracted all eyes. Strangers looked upon it as lumber, but the old people did not care for that; they loved it. One day\u2014it was the watchman's birthday\u2014the old woman approached the lamp, smiling to herself, and said, \""I will have an illumination today, in honor of my old man.\"" The lamp rattled in its metal frame, for it thought, \""Now at last I shall have a light within me.\"" But, after all, no wax light was placed in the lamp\u2014only oil, as usual.\n\nThe lamp burned through the whole evening and began to perceive too clearly that the gift of the stars would remain a hidden treasure all its life. Then it had a dream; for to one with its faculties, dreaming was not difficult. It dreamed that the old people were dead and that it had been taken to the iron foundry to be melted down. This caused the lamp quite as much anxiety as on the day when it had been called upon to appear before the mayor and the council at the town hall. But though it had been endowed with the power of falling into decay from rust when it pleased, it did not make use of this power. It was therefore put into the melting furnace and changed into as elegant an iron candlestick as you could wish to see\u2014one intended to hold a wax taper. The candlestick was in the form of an angel holding a nosegay, in the center of which the wax taper was to be placed. It was to stand on a green writing table in a very pleasant room, where there were many books scattered about and splendid paintings on the walls.\n\nThe owner of the room was a poet and a man of intellect. Everything he thought or wrote was pictured around him. Nature showed herself to him sometimes in the dark forests, sometimes in cheerful meadows where the storks were strutting about, or on the deck of a ship sailing across the foaming sea, with the clear, blue sky above, or at night in the glittering stars.\n\n\""What powers I possess!\"" said the lamp, awaking from its dream. \""I could almost wish to be melted down; but no, that must not be while the old people live. They love me for myself alone; they keep me bright and supply me with oil. I am as well off as the picture of the Congress, in which they take so much pleasure.\"" And from that time, it felt at rest in itself, and not more so than such an honorable old lamp really deserved to be."""
1,Brave Tin Soldier,"""There were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers, who were all brothers, for they had been made out of the same old tin spoon. They shouldered arms and looked straight before them, and wore a splendid uniform, red and blue. The first thing in the world they ever heard were the words, \""Tin soldiers!\"" uttered by a little boy, who clapped his hands with delight when the lid of the box, in which they lay, was taken off. They were given to him for a birthday present, and he stood at the table to set them up. The soldiers were all exactly alike, except for one, who had only one leg; he had been left to the last, and then there was not enough of the melted tin to finish him, so they made him stand firmly on one leg, which made him very remarkable.\n\nThe table on which the tin soldiers stood was covered with other playthings, but the most attractive to the eye was a pretty little paper castle. Through the small windows, the rooms could be seen. In front of the castle, a number of little trees surrounded a piece of looking-glass, which was intended to represent a transparent lake. Swans made of wax swam on the lake and were reflected in it. All this was very pretty, but the prettiest of all was a tiny little lady, who stood at the open door of the castle; she was also made of paper and wore a dress of clear muslin, with a narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders just like a scarf. In front of her was fixed a glittering tinsel rose, as large as her whole face.\n\nThe little lady was a dancer, and she stretched out both her arms and raised one of her legs so high that the tin soldier could not see it at all. He thought that she, like himself, had only one leg. \""That is the wife for me,\"" he thought; \""but she is too grand and lives in a castle, while I have only a box to live in, five-and-twenty of us altogether; that is no place for her. Still, I must try and make her acquaintance.\"" Then he laid himself at full length on the table behind a snuff-box that stood upon it, so that he could peep at the little delicate lady, who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance.\n\nWhen evening came, the other tin soldiers were all placed in the box, and the people of the house went to bed. Then the playthings began to have their own games together, to pay visits, to have sham fights, and to give balls. The tin soldiers rattled in their box; they wanted to get out and join the amusements, but they could not open the lid. The nut-crackers played at leap-frog, and the pencil jumped about the table. There was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk, and in poetry too. Only the tin soldier and the dancer remained in their places. She stood on tiptoe, with her legs stretched out, as firmly as he did on his one leg. He never took his eyes from her for even a moment. The clock struck twelve, and, with a bounce, up sprang the lid of the snuff-box; but instead of snuff, there jumped up a little black goblin, for the snuff-box was a toy puzzle.\n\n\""Tin soldier,\"" said the goblin, \""don't wish for what does not belong to you.\"" But the tin soldier pretended not to hear. \""Very well; wait till tomorrow, then,\"" said the goblin. When the children came in the next morning, they placed the tin soldier in the window. Now, whether it was the goblin who did it, or the draught, is not known, but the window flew open, and out fell the tin soldier, heels over head, from the third story into the street beneath. It was a terrible fall; for he came head downwards, his helmet and his bayonet stuck in between the flagstones, and his one leg up in the air. The servant maid and the little boy went downstairs directly to look for him, but he was nowhere to be seen, although once they nearly trod upon him. If he had called out, \""Here I am,\"" it would have been all right, but he was too proud to cry out for help while he wore a uniform.\n\nPresently it began to rain, and the drops fell faster and faster until there was a heavy shower. When it was over, two boys happened to pass by, and one of them said, \""Look, there is a tin soldier. He ought to have a boat to sail in.\"" So they made a boat out of a newspaper and placed the tin soldier in it, sending him sailing down the gutter while the two boys ran by the side of it, clapping their hands. Good gracious, what large waves arose in that gutter! and how fast the stream rolled on! for the rain had been very heavy. The paper boat rocked up and down and turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier trembled; yet he remained firm; his countenance did not change; he looked straight before him and shouldered his musket. Suddenly the boat shot under a bridge which formed a part of a drain, and then it was as dark as the tin soldier's box.\n\n\""Where am I going now?\"" thought he. \""This is the black goblin's fault, I am sure. Ah, well, if the little lady were only here with me in the boat, I should not care for any darkness.\"" Suddenly there appeared a great water-rat, who lived in the drain. \""Have you a passport?\"" asked the rat, \""give it to me at once.\"" But the tin soldier remained silent and held his musket tighter than ever. The boat sailed on, and the rat followed it. How he did gnash his teeth and cry out to the bits of wood and straw, \""Stop him, stop him; he has not paid toll and has not shown his pass.\"" But the stream rushed on stronger and stronger. The tin soldier could already see daylight shining where the arch ended. Then he heard a roaring sound quite terrible enough to frighten the bravest man.\n\nAt the end of the tunnel, the drain fell into a large canal over a steep place, which made it as dangerous for him as a waterfall would be to us. He was too close to it to stop, so the boat rushed on, and the poor tin soldier could only hold himself as stiffly as possible, without moving an eyelid, to show that he was not afraid. The boat whirled round three or four times and then filled with water to the very edge; nothing could save it from sinking. He now stood up to his neck in water, while deeper and deeper sank the boat, and the paper became soft and loose with the wet, till at last the water closed over the soldier's head. He thought of the elegant little dancer whom he should never see again, and the words of the song sounded in his ears--\""Farewell, warrior! ever brave, Drifting onward to thy grave.\""\n\nThen the paper boat fell to pieces, and the soldier sank into the water and immediately afterwards was swallowed up by a great fish. Oh, how dark it was inside the fish! A great deal darker than in the tunnel, and narrower too, but the tin soldier continued firm and lay at full length shouldering his musket. The fish swam to and fro, making the most wonderful movements, but at last, he became quite still. After a while, a flash of lightning seemed to pass through him, and then the daylight approached, and a voice cried out, \""I declare here is the tin soldier.\"" The fish had been caught, taken to the market, and sold to the cook, who took him into the kitchen and cut him open with a large knife. She picked up the soldier and held him by the waist between her finger and thumb, and carried him into the room. They were all anxious to see this wonderful soldier who had traveled about inside a fish; but he was not at all proud. They placed him on the table, and--how many curious things do happen in the world!--there he was in the very same room from the window of which he had fallen. There were the same children, the same playthings standing on the table, and the pretty castle with the elegant little dancer at the door; she still balanced herself on one leg and held up the other, so she was as firm as himself.\n\nIt touched the tin soldier so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept them back. He only looked at her, and they both remained silent. Presently one of the little boys took up the tin soldier and threw him into the stove. He had no reason for doing so; therefore, it must have been the fault of the black goblin who lived in the snuff-box. The flames lighted up the tin soldier as he stood; the heat was very terrible, but whether it proceeded from the real fire or from the fire of love he could not tell. Then he could see that the bright colors were faded from his uniform, but whether they had been washed off during his journey or from the effects of his sorrow, no one could say. He looked at the little lady, and she looked at him. He felt himself melting away, but he still remained firm with his gun on his shoulder.\n\nSuddenly the door of the room flew open, and the draught of air caught up the little dancer; she fluttered like a sylph right into the stove by the side of the tin soldier and was instantly in flames and was gone. The tin soldier melted down into a lump, and the next morning, when the maid servant took the ashes out of the stove, she found him in the shape of a little tin heart. But of the little dancer, nothing remained but the tinsel rose, which was burnt black as a cinder."""
9,Snail Rose Tree,"""Round about the garden ran a hedge of hazel-bushes; beyond the hedge were fields and meadows with cows and sheep. In the middle of the garden stood a Rose-tree in bloom, under which sat a Snail, whose shell contained a great deal\u2014that is, himself. \""Only wait till my time comes,\"" he said; \""I shall do more than grow roses, bear nuts, or give milk, like the hazel-bush, the cows, and the sheep.\"" \""I expect a great deal from you,\"" said the rose-tree. \""May I ask when it will appear?\"" \""I take my time,\"" said the snail. \""You're always in such a hurry. That does not excite expectation.\""\n\nThe following year, the snail lay in almost the same spot, basking in the sunshine under the rose-tree, which was again budding and bearing roses as fresh and beautiful as ever. The snail crept half out of his shell, stretched out his horns, and drew them in again. \""Everything is just as it was last year! No progress at all; the rose-tree sticks to its roses and gets no farther.\"" The summer and the autumn passed; the rose-tree bore roses and buds until the snow fell and the weather became raw and wet. Then it bent down its head, and the snail crept into the ground.\n\nA new year began; the roses made their appearance, and the snail made his too. \""You are an old rose-tree now,\"" said the snail. \""You must make haste and die. You have given the world all that you had in you; whether it was of much importance is a question that I have not had time to think about. But this much is clear and plain, that you have not done the least for your inner development, or you would have produced something else. Have you anything to say in defense? You will now soon be nothing but a stick. Do you understand what I say?\"" \""You frighten me,\"" said the rose-tree. \""I have never thought of that.\""\n\n\""No, you have never taken the trouble to think at all. Have you ever given yourself an account of why you bloomed, and how your blooming comes about\u2014why just in that way and in no other?\"" \""No,\"" said the rose-tree. \""I bloom in gladness because I cannot do otherwise. The sun shone and warmed me, and the air refreshed me; I drank the clear dew and the invigorating rain. I breathed and I lived! Out of the earth there arose a power within me, whilst from above I also received strength; I felt an ever-renewed and ever-increasing happiness, and therefore I was obliged to go on blooming. That was my life; I could not do otherwise.\""\n\n\""You have led a very easy life,\"" remarked the snail. \""Certainly. Everything was given to me,\"" said the rose-tree. \""But still more was given to you. Yours is one of those deep-thinking natures, one of those highly gifted minds that astonish the world.\"" \""I have not the slightest intention of doing so,\"" said the snail. \""The world is nothing to me. What have I to do with the world? I have enough to do with myself, and enough in myself.\""\n\n\""But must we not all here on earth give up our best parts to others, and offer as much as lies in our power? It is true, I have only given roses. But you\u2014you who are so richly endowed\u2014what have you given to the world? What will you give it?\"" \""What have I given? What am I going to give? I spit at it; it's good for nothing, and does not concern me. For my part, you may go on bearing roses; you cannot do anything else. Let the hazel bush bear nuts, and the cows and sheep give milk; they have each their public. I have mine in myself. I retire within myself and there I stop. The world is nothing to me.\"" With this, the snail withdrew into his house and blocked up the entrance.\n\n\""That's very sad,\"" said the rose-tree. \""I cannot creep into myself, however much I might wish to do so; I have to go on bearing roses. Then they drop their leaves, which are blown away by the wind. But I once saw how a rose was laid in the mistress's hymn-book, and how one of my roses found a place in the bosom of a young beautiful girl, and how another was kissed by the lips of a child in the glad joy of life. That did me good; it was a real blessing. Those are my recollections, my life.\"" And the rose-tree went on blooming in innocence, while the snail lay idling in his house\u2014the world was nothing to him.\n\nYears passed by. The snail had turned to earth in the earth, and the rose-tree too. Even the souvenir rose in the hymn-book was faded, but in the garden, there were other rose-trees and other snails. The latter crept into their houses and spat at the world, for it did not concern them. Shall we read the story all over again? It will be just the same."""
10,Snow Man,"""""It is so delightfully cold,\"" said the Snow Man, \""that it makes my whole body crackle. This is just the kind of wind to blow life into one. How that great red thing up there is staring at me!\"" He meant the sun, who was just setting. \""It shall not make me wink. I shall manage to keep the pieces.\"" He had two triangular pieces of tile in his head, instead of eyes. His mouth was made of an old broken rake, and was, of course, furnished with teeth. He had been brought into existence amidst the joyous shouts of boys, the jingling of sleigh-bells, and the slashing of whips. The sun went down, and the full moon rose, large, round, and clear, shining in the deep blue.\n\n\""There it comes again, from the other side,\"" said the Snow Man, who supposed the sun was showing himself once more. \""Ah, I have cured him of staring, though. Now he may hang up there, and shine, that I may see myself. If I only knew how to manage to move away from this place,--I should so like to move. If I could, I would slide along yonder on the ice, as I have seen the boys do. But I don't understand how. I don't even know how to run.\"" \n\n\""Away, away,\"" barked the old yard-dog. He was quite hoarse and could not pronounce \""Bow wow\"" properly. He had once been an indoor dog, and lay by the fire, and he had been hoarse ever since. \""The sun will make you run some day. I saw him, last winter, make your predecessor run, and his predecessor before him. Away, away, they all have to go.\"" \n\n\""I don't understand you, comrade,\"" said the Snow Man. \""Is that thing up yonder to teach me to run? I saw it running itself a little while ago, and now it has come creeping up from the other side.\"" \n\n\""You know nothing at all,\"" replied the yard-dog; \""but then, you've only lately been patched up. What you see yonder is the moon, and the one before it was the sun. It will come again tomorrow, and most likely teach you to run down into the ditch by the well. I think the weather is going to change. I can feel such pricks and stabs in my left leg. I am sure there is going to be a change.\"" \n\n\""I don't understand him,\"" said the Snow Man to himself. \""But I have a feeling that he is talking of something very disagreeable. The one who stared so just now, and whom he calls the sun, is not my friend; I can feel that too.\"" \n\n\""Away, away,\"" barked the yard-dog, and then he turned round three times and crept into his kennel to sleep. \n\nThere was really a change in the weather. Towards morning, a thick fog covered the whole country round, and a keen wind arose, so that the cold seemed to freeze one's bones. But when the sun rose, the sight was splendid. Trees and bushes were covered with hoar frost and looked like a forest of white coral. While on every twig glittered frozen dew-drops. The many delicate forms concealed in summer by luxuriant foliage were now clearly defined and looked like glittering lace-work. From every twig glistened a white radiance. The birch, waving in the wind, looked full of life, like trees in summer. Its appearance was wondrously beautiful. And where the sun shone, how everything glittered and sparkled, as if diamond dust had been strewn about. While the snowy carpet of the earth appeared as if covered with diamonds, from which countless lights gleamed, whiter than even the snow itself.\n\n\""This is really beautiful,\"" said a young girl, who had come into the garden with a young man. They both stood still near the Snow Man and contemplated the glittering scene. \""Summer cannot show a more beautiful sight,\"" she exclaimed, while her eyes sparkled. \""And we can't have such a fellow as this in the summertime,\"" replied the young man, pointing to the Snow Man; \""he is capital.\"" The girl laughed, and nodded at the Snow Man, and then tripped away over the snow with her friend. The snow creaked and crackled beneath her feet, as if she had been treading on starch.\n\n\""Who are these two?\"" asked the Snow Man of the yard-dog. \""You have been here longer than I have. Do you know them?\"" \n\n\""Of course I know them,\"" replied the yard-dog; \""she has stroked my back many times, and he has given me a bone of meat. I never bite those two.\"" \n\n\""But what are they?\"" asked the Snow Man. \n\n\""They are lovers,\"" he replied; \""they will go and live in the same kennel by-and-by, and gnaw at the same bone. Away, away!\"" \n\n\""Are they the same kind of beings as you and I?\"" asked the Snow Man. \n\n\""Well, they belong to the same master,\"" retorted the yard-dog. \""Certainly people who were only born yesterday know very little. I can see that in you. I have age and experience. I know everyone here in the house, and I know there was once a time when I did not lie out here in the cold, fastened to a chain. Away, away!\"" \n\n\""The cold is delightful,\"" said the Snow Man; \""but do tell me, only you must not clank your chain so. It jars all through me when you do that.\"" \n\n\""Away, away!\"" barked the yard-dog. \""I'll tell you; they said I was a pretty little fellow once. Then I used to lie in a velvet-covered chair, up at the master's house, and sit in the mistress's lap. They used to kiss my nose and wipe my paws with an embroidered handkerchief, and I was called 'Ami, dear Ami, sweet Ami.' But after a while, I grew too big for them, and they sent me away to the housekeeper's room. So I came to live on the lower story. You can look into the room from where you stand and see where I was master once. I was indeed master to the housekeeper. It was certainly a smaller room than those upstairs. But I was more comfortable, for I was not being continually taken hold of and pulled about by the children as I had been. I received quite as good food, or even better. I had my own cushion, and there was a stove--it is the finest thing in the world at this season of the year. I used to go under the stove and lie down quite beneath it. Ah, I still dream of that stove. Away, away!\"" \n\n\""Does a stove look beautiful?\"" asked the Snow Man, \""is it at all like me?\"" \n\n\""It is just the reverse of you,\"" said the dog; \""it's as black as a crow, and has a long neck and a brass knob. It eats firewood, so that fire spurts out of its mouth. We should keep on one side, or under it, to be comfortable. You can see it through the window, from where you stand.\"" \n\nThen the Snow Man looked and saw a bright polished thing with a brazen knob, and fire gleaming from the lower part of it. The Snow Man felt quite a strange sensation come over him. It was very odd; he knew not what it meant, and he could not account for it. But there are people who are not men of snow, who understand what it is. \""And why did you leave her?\"" asked the Snow Man, for it seemed to him that the stove must be of the female sex. \""How could you give up such a comfortable place?\"" \n\n\""I was obliged,\"" replied the yard-dog. \""They turned me out of doors and chained me up here. I had bitten the youngest of my master's sons in the leg because he kicked away the bone I was gnawing. 'Bone for bone,' I thought. But they were so angry, and from that time I have been fastened with a chain and lost my bone. Don't you hear how hoarse I am? Away, away! I can't talk any more like other dogs. Away, away, that is the end of it all.\"" \n\nBut the Snow Man was no longer listening. He was looking into the housekeeper's room on the lower storey, where the stove stood on its four iron legs, looking about the same size as the Snow Man himself. \""What a strange crackling I feel within me,\"" he said. \""Shall I ever get in there? It is an innocent wish, and innocent wishes are sure to be fulfilled. I must go in there and lean against her, even if I have to break the window.\"" \n\n\""You must never go in there,\"" said the yard-dog, \""for if you approach the stove, you'll melt away, away.\"" \n\n\""I might as well go,\"" said the Snow Man, \""for I think I am breaking up as it is.\"" \n\nDuring the whole day, the Snow Man stood looking in through the window, and in the twilight hour, the room became still more inviting, for from the stove came a gentle glow, not like the sun or the moon. No, only the bright light which gleams from a stove when it has been well fed. When the door of the stove was opened, the flames darted out of its mouth. This is customary with all stoves. The light of the flames fell directly on the face and breast of the Snow Man with a ruddy gleam. \""I can endure it no longer,\"" said he; \""how beautiful it looks when it stretches out its tongue?\"" \n\nThe night was long but did not appear so to the Snow Man, who stood there enjoying his own reflections and crackling with the cold. In the morning, the window-panes of the housekeeper's room were covered with ice. They were the most beautiful ice-flowers any Snow Man could desire, but they concealed the stove. These window-panes would not thaw, and he could see nothing of the stove, which he pictured to himself as if it had been a lovely human being. The snow crackled and the wind whistled around him. It was just the kind of frosty weather a Snow Man might thoroughly enjoy. But he did not enjoy it. How, indeed, could he enjoy anything when he was \""stove sick?\"" \n\n\""That is a terrible disease for a Snow Man,\"" said the yard-dog; \""I have suffered from it myself, but I got over it. Away, away,\"" he barked, and then he added, \""the weather is going to change.\"" And the weather did change. It began to thaw. As the warmth increased, the Snow Man decreased. He said nothing and made no complaint, which is a sure sign. One morning he broke and sunk down altogether. Behold, where he had stood, something like a broomstick remained sticking up in the ground. It was the pole round which the boys had built him up. \""Ah, now I understand why he had such a great longing for the stove,\"" said the yard-dog. \""Why, there's the shovel that is used for cleaning out the stove, fastened to the pole.\"" The Snow Man had a stove scraper in his body. That was what moved him so. \""But it's all over now. Away, away.\"" And soon the winter passed. \""Away, away,\"" barked the hoarse yard-dog. But the girls in the house sang, \n\n\""Come from your fragrant home, green thyme;  \nStretch your soft branches, willow-tree;  \nThe months are bringing the sweet spring-time,  \nWhen the lark in the sky sings joyfully.  \nCome gentle sun, while the cuckoo sings,  \nAnd I'll mock his note in my wanderings.\"" \n\nAnd nobody thought any more of the Snow Man."""
12,Two Maidens,"""Have you ever seen a maiden? I mean what our pavers call a maiden, a thing with which they ram down the paving-stones in the roads. A maiden of this kind is made altogether of wood, broad below, and girt round with iron rings. At the top, she is narrow and has a stick passed across through her waist, and this stick forms the arms of the maiden.\n\nIn the shed stood two Maidens of this kind. They had their place among shovels, hand-carts, wheelbarrows, and measuring-tapes; and to all this company, the news had come that the Maidens were no longer to be called \""maidens,\"" but \""hand-rammers,\"" which word was the newest and the only correct designation among the pavers for the thing we all know from the old times by the name of \""the maiden.\"" \n\nNow, there are among us human creatures certain individuals who are known as \""emancipated women,\"" as, for instance, principals of institutions, dancers who stand professionally on one leg, milliners, and sick-nurses; and with this class of emancipated women, the two Maidens in the shed associated themselves. They were \""maidens\"" among the paver folk and determined not to give up this honorable appellation and let themselves be miscalled \""rammers.\"" \n\n\""Maiden is a human name, but hand-rammer is a thing, and we won't be called things\u2014that's insulting us,\"" declared the younger maiden. \""My lover would be ready to give up his engagement,\"" she continued, \""for he wants to marry me as a maiden, but whether he would have me were I a hand-rammer is a question, so I won't have my name changed.\"" The elder one chimed in, \""And I would rather have both my arms broken off.\""\n\nBut the Wheelbarrow was of a different opinion; and the Wheelbarrow was looked upon as of some consequence, for he considered himself a quarter of a coach because he went about upon one wheel. \""I must submit to your notice,\"" he said, \""that the name 'maiden' is common enough and not nearly so refined as 'hand-rammer' or 'stamper,' which latter has also been proposed. Through this, you would be introduced into the category of seals; and only think of the great stamp of state, which impresses the royal seal that gives effect to the laws! No, in your case, I would surrender my maiden name.\"" \n\n\""No, certainly not!\"" exclaimed the elder. \""I am too old for that.\"" \n\n\""I presume you have never heard of what is called 'European necessity?'\"" observed the honest Measuring Tape. \""One must be able to adapt oneself to time and circumstances, and if there is a law that the 'maiden' is to be called 'hand-rammer,' why, she must be called 'hand-rammer,' and no pouting will avail, for everything has its measure.\"" \n\n\""No; if there must be a change,\"" said the younger, \""I should prefer to be called 'Missy,' for that reminds one a little of maidens.\"" \n\n\""But I would rather be chopped to chips,\"" said the elder. \n\nAt last, they all went to work. The Maidens rode\u2014that is, they were put in a wheelbarrow, and that was a distinction; but still, they were called \""hand-rammers.\"" \n\n\""Mai--!\"" they said, as they were bumped upon the pavement. \""Mai--!\"" and they were very nearly pronouncing the whole word \""maiden;\"" but they broke off short and swallowed the last syllable, for after mature deliberation they considered it beneath their dignity to protest. However, they always called each other \""maiden\"" and praised the good old days in which everything had been called by its right name, and those who were maidens were called maidens. They remained as they were; for the hammer really broke off his engagement with the younger one, for nothing would suit him but he must have a maiden for his bride."""
14,What The Goodman Does Is Always Right,"""I will tell you a story that was told to me when I was a little boy. Every time I think of this story, it seems to me more and more charming; for it is with stories as it is with many people\u2014they become better as they grow older.\n\nI have no doubt that you have been in the country and seen a very old farmhouse, with a thatched roof, and mosses and small plants growing wild upon it. There is a stork's nest on the ridge of the gable, for we cannot do without the stork. The walls of the house are sloping, and the windows are low, and only one of the latter is made to open. The baking oven sticks out of the wall like a great knob. An elder tree hangs over the palings, and beneath its branches, at the foot of the paling, is a pool of water in which a few ducks are sporting. There is a yard dog, too, that barks at all comers.\n\nJust such a farmhouse as this stood in a country lane, and in it dwelt an old couple, a peasant and his wife. Small as their possessions were, they had one thing they could not do without, and that was a horse, which contrived to live upon the grass found by the side of the highroad. The old peasant rode into the town upon this horse, and his neighbors often borrowed it of him and paid for the loan of it by rendering some service to the old couple. Yet after a time, the old people thought it would be as well to sell the horse or exchange it for something which might be more useful to them. But what should this something be?\n\n\""You will know best, old man,\"" said the wife. \""It is fair day today; so ride into town and get rid of the horse for money or make a good exchange. Whichever you do will please me; so ride to the fair.\"" She fastened his neckerchief for him, for she could do that better than he could, and she could also tie it very prettily in a double bow. She also smoothed his hat round and round with the palm of her hand and gave him a kiss. Then he rode away upon the horse that was to be sold or bartered for something else. Yes, the goodman knew what he was about. The sun shone with great heat, and not a cloud was to be seen in the sky. The road was very dusty, for many people, all going to the fair, were driving, riding, or walking upon it. There was no shelter anywhere from the hot sun.\n\nAmong the crowd, a man came trudging along, driving a cow to the fair. The cow was as beautiful a creature as any cow could be. \""She gives good milk, I am certain,\"" said the peasant to himself. \""That would be a very good exchange: the cow for the horse. Halloo there! you with the cow,\"" he said. \""I tell you what, I dare say a horse is of more value than a cow; but I don't care for that. A cow will be more useful to me, so if you like we'll exchange.\"" \""To be sure I will,\"" said the man. Accordingly, the exchange was made.\n\nWhen the matter was settled, the peasant might have turned back, for he had done the business he came to do. But having made up his mind to go to the fair, he determined to do so, if only to have a look at it. So on he went to the town with his cow. Leading the animal, he strode on sturdily, and, after a short time, overtook a man who was driving a sheep. It was a good fat sheep, with a fine fleece on its back. \""I should like to have that fellow,\"" said the peasant to himself. \""There is plenty of grass for him by our palings, and in the winter we could keep him in the room with us. Perhaps it would be more profitable to have a sheep than a cow. Shall I exchange?\""\n\nThe man with the sheep was quite ready, and the bargain was quickly made. And then our peasant continued his way on the highroad with his sheep. Soon after this, he overtook another man, who had come into the road from a field and was carrying a large goose under his arm. \""What a heavy creature you have there!\"" said the peasant. \""It has plenty of feathers and plenty of fat, and would look well tied to a string, or paddling in the water at our place. That would be very useful to my old woman; she could make all sorts of profit out of it. How often she has said, 'If we only had a goose!' Now here is an opportunity, and, if possible, I will get it for her. Shall we exchange? I will give you my sheep for your goose, and thanks into the bargain.\""\n\nThe other had not the least objection, and accordingly the exchange was made, and our peasant became possessor of the goose. By this time he had arrived very near the town. The crowd on the highroad had been gradually increasing, and there was quite a rush of men and cattle. The cattle walked on the path and by the palings, and at the turnpike gate, they even walked into the toll keeper's potato field, where one fowl was strutting about with a string tied to its leg, lest it should take fright at the crowd and run away and get lost.\n\nThe tail feathers of this fowl were very short, and it winked with both its eyes, and looked very cunning as it said, \""Cluck, cluck.\"" What were the thoughts of the fowl as it said this I cannot tell you, but as soon as our good man saw it, he thought, \""Why, that's the finest fowl I ever saw in my life; it's finer than our parson's brood hen, upon my word. I should like to have that fowl. Fowls can always pick up a few grains that lie about, and almost keep themselves. I think it would be a good exchange if I could get it for my goose. Shall we exchange?\"" he asked the toll keeper. \""Exchange?\"" repeated the man. \""Well, it would not be a bad thing.\""\n\nSo they made an exchange; the toll keeper at the turnpike gate kept the goose, and the peasant carried off the fowl. Now he really had done a great deal of business on his way to the fair, and he was hot and tired. He wanted something to eat, and a glass of ale to refresh himself; so he turned his steps to an inn. He was just about to enter when the ostler came out, and they met at the door. The ostler was carrying a sack. \""What have you in that sack?\"" asked the peasant. \""Rotten apples,\"" answered the ostler; \""a whole sackful of them. They will do to feed the pigs with.\""\n\n\""Why, that will be terrible waste,\"" the peasant replied. \""I should like to take them home to my old woman. Last year the old apple tree by the grassplot bore only one apple, and we kept it in the cupboard till it was quite withered and rotten. It was property, my old woman said. Here she would see a great deal of property\u2014a whole sackful. I should like to show them to her.\"" \""What will you give me for the sackful?\"" asked the ostler. \""What will I give? Well, I will give you my fowl in exchange.\"" So he gave up the fowl and received the apples, which he carried into the inn parlor. He leaned the sack carefully against the stove, and then went to the table. But the stove was hot, and he had not thought of that.\n\nMany guests were present\u2014horse-dealers, cattle-drovers, and two Englishmen. The Englishmen were so rich that their pockets bulged and seemed ready to burst; and they could bet too, as you shall hear. Hiss\u2014s\u2014s, hiss\u2014s\u2014s. What could that be by the stove? The apples were beginning to roast. \""What is that?\"" asked one. \""Why, do you know\u2014\"" said our peasant, and then he told them the whole story of the horse, which he had exchanged for a cow, and all the rest of it, down to the apples.\n\n\""Well, your old woman will give it to you when you get home,\"" said one of the Englishmen. \""Won't there be a noise?\"" \""What! Give me what?\"" said the peasant. \""Why, she will kiss me, and say, 'What the goodman does is always right.'\"" \""Let us lay a wager on it,\"" said the Englishman. \""We'll wager you a ton of coined gold, a hundred pounds to the hundredweight.\"" \""No, a bushel will be enough,\"" replied the peasant. \""I can only set a bushel of apples against it, and I'll throw myself and my old woman into the bargain. That will pile up the measure, I fancy.\"" \""Done! taken!\"" and so the bet was made.\n\nThen the landlord's coach came to the door, and the two Englishmen and the peasant got in, and away they drove. Soon they had stopped at the peasant's hut. \""Good evening, old woman.\"" \""Good evening, old man.\"" \""I've made the exchange.\"" \""Ah, well, you understand what you're about,\"" said the woman. Then she embraced him and paid no attention to the strangers, nor did she notice the sack. \""I got a cow in exchange for the horse.\"" \""Oh, how delightful!\"" said she. \""Now we shall have plenty of milk, and butter, and cheese on the table. That was a capital exchange.\""\n\n\""Yes, but I changed the cow for a sheep.\"" \""Ah, better still!\"" cried the wife. \""You always think of everything; we have just enough pasture for a sheep. Ewe's milk and cheese, woolen jackets and stockings! The cow could not give all these, and her hairs only fall off. How you think of everything!\"" \""But I changed away the sheep for a goose.\"" \""Then we shall have roast goose to eat this year. You dear old man, you are always thinking of something to please me. This is delightful. We can let the goose walk about with a string tied to her leg, so that she will get fatter still before we roast her.\""\n\n\""But I gave away the goose for a fowl.\"" \""A fowl! Well, that was a good exchange,\"" replied the woman. \""The fowl will lay eggs and hatch them, and we shall have chickens. We shall soon have a poultry yard. Oh, this is just what I was wishing for!\"" \""Yes, but I exchanged the fowl for a sack of shriveled apples.\"" \""What! I must really give you a kiss for that!\"" exclaimed the wife. \""My dear, good husband, now I'll tell you something. Do you know, almost as soon as you left me this morning, I began thinking of what I could give you nice for supper this evening, and then I thought of fried eggs and bacon, with sweet herbs. I had eggs and bacon but lacked the herbs, so I went over to the schoolmaster's. I knew they had plenty of herbs, but the schoolmistress is very mean, although she can smile so sweetly. I begged her to lend me a handful of herbs. 'Lend!' she exclaimed, 'I have nothing to lend. I could not even lend you a shriveled apple, my dear woman.' But now I can lend her ten, or a whole sackful, for which I'm very glad. It makes me laugh to think of it.\"" Then she gave him a hearty kiss.\n\n\""Well, I like all this,\"" said both the Englishmen; \""always going down the hill and yet always merry. It's worth the money to see it.\"" So they paid a hundredweight of gold to the peasant who, whatever he did, was not scolded but kissed. Yes, it always pays best when the wife sees and maintains that her husband knows best and that whatever he does is right.\n\nThis is a story which I heard when I was a child. And now you have heard it, too, and know that \""What the goodman does is always right.\"""""
30,The History Of Jack The Giant Killer,"""In the reign of the famous King Arthur, there lived in Cornwall a lad named Jack, who was a boy of a bold temper. He took delight in hearing or reading about conjurers, giants, and fairies, and would listen eagerly to the deeds of the knights of King Arthur's Round Table. In those days, a huge giant, eighteen feet high and nine feet round, terrorized the people of Cornwall. He dwelt on St. Michael's Mount, in a gloomy cavern, and would wade over to the mainland in search of prey, often carrying off half a dozen oxen and tying three times as many sheep and hogs around his waist.\n\nThe giant had been a menace for many years when Jack resolved to destroy him. Armed with a horn, a shovel, a pickaxe, his armor, and a dark lantern, Jack ventured to the mount one winter's evening. He dug a pit twenty-two feet deep and twenty feet broad, covering it to make it look like solid ground. Then, he blew his horn loudly, awakening the giant, who emerged from his den, threatening Jack. However, as the giant took a step forward, he tumbled headlong into the pit. Seizing the opportunity, Jack struck him a fatal blow with his pickaxe, killing him. Jack then returned home to share the news with his friends.\n\nNot long after, another giant named Blunderbore vowed revenge on Jack if he ever caught him. This giant kept an enchanted castle in a lonely wood. Some time after the death of Cormoran, Jack was passing through the wood and, feeling weary, sat down to sleep. The giant found him and carried him off to his castle, locking him in a room filled with the bones of previous victims. Soon after, Blunderbore went to fetch his brother to feast on Jack's flesh. \n\nRealizing the danger, Jack spotted a strong cord in the corner of the room. He took courage and fashioned a slip-knot, using it to choke both giants as they approached. Once they were incapacitated, Jack slid down the rope and stabbed them to the heart. Afterward, he found a great bunch of keys in Blunderbore's pocket and searched the castle, discovering three ladies tied up and nearly starved. They revealed that their husbands had been killed by the giants, and they were condemned to die for refusing to eat their flesh. \n\nJack assured the ladies that he had ended the giants' reign of terror and offered them the castle and its riches as compensation for their suffering. He then continued his journey to Wales, as he had little money. Eventually, he arrived at a handsome house, where a Welsh giant welcomed him. Jack, pretending to be a traveler who had lost his way, was shown to a room with a good bed. However, he could not sleep, as he overheard the giant plotting to kill him during the night.\n\nDetermined to outsmart the giant, Jack replaced himself in bed with a thick log and hid in a dark corner. When the giant entered and struck the bed with his club, he thought he had killed Jack. In the morning, Jack boldly thanked the giant for his hospitality, leaving the giant bewildered. The giant, ashamed to be outdone by Jack, prepared a breakfast of hasty-pudding. Jack cleverly devised a way to hide the pudding in a leathern bag, making it seem as though he had eaten it all.\n\nAfter breakfast, Jack boasted that he could cure all wounds with a touch and demonstrated by cutting open the bag, spilling the pudding. Enraged and embarrassed, the giant attempted to replicate the trick but ended up killing himself. With his confidence growing, Jack equipped himself with a horse, a cap of knowledge, a sword of sharpness, shoes of swiftness, and an invisible coat to aid him in future adventures.\n\nOn his travels, Jack encountered a monstrous giant dragging a knight and his lady by their hair. He quickly donned his invisible coat and attacked the giant, eventually cutting off his legs and delivering a fatal blow. The grateful knight and lady invited Jack to their home, but he insisted on finding the giant's lair first. Following the knight's directions, Jack soon came across another giant waiting for his brother's return. \n\nJack, using his invisible coat, approached the giant and attempted to strike him down. However, he only managed to cut off the giant's nose, prompting the giant to retaliate. Jack quickly dispatched him as well and continued his journey until he reached a hermit's house at the foot of a high mountain. The hermit informed Jack of an enchanted castle at the mountain's peak, guarded by the giant Galligantus and a vile magician, who had transformed a duke's daughter into a deer.\n\nDetermined to break the enchantment, Jack promised to confront the giant and magician. The next morning, he climbed the mountain, passing two fiery griffins unnoticed due to his invisible coat. At the castle gate, he found a golden trumpet with an inscription stating that whoever could blow it would cause the giant's downfall. Jack seized the trumpet and blew a shrill blast, causing the gates to fly open and the castle to tremble.\n\nThe giant and the magician, realizing their end was near, trembled in fear. Jack swiftly killed the giant and watched as a whirlwind carried the magician away. All the knights and ladies who had been transformed into animals returned to their true forms, and the castle vanished like smoke. Jack presented the head of Galligantus to King Arthur, and the knights and ladies rested at the hermit's home before returning to the court.\n\nJack's fame spread throughout the land, and at the King's request, the duke offered his daughter in marriage to Jack, much to the joy of the kingdom. The King also granted Jack a large estate, where he and his lady lived happily for the rest of their days."""
33,Which Was The Foolishest,"""In a little village that stood on a wide plain, where you could see the sun from the moment he rose to the moment he set, there lived two couples side by side. The men, who worked under the same master, were quite good friends, but the wives were always quarrelling, and the subject they quarrelled most about was which of the two had the stupidest husband. Unlike most women\u2014who think that anything that belongs to them must be better than what belongs to anyone else\u2014each thought her husband the more foolish of the two.\n\n\""You should just see what he does!\"" one said to her neighbour. \""He puts on the baby's frock upside down, and, one day, I found him trying to feed her with boiling soup, and her mouth was scalded for days after. Then he picks up stones in the road and sows them instead of potatoes, and one day he wanted to go into the garden from the top window, because he declared it was a shorter way than through the door.\""\n\n\""That is bad enough, of course,\"" answered the other; \""but it is really NOTHING to what I have to endure every day from MY husband. If, when I am busy, I ask him to go and feed the poultry, he is certain to give them some poisonous stuff instead of their proper food, and when I visit the yard next I find them all dead. Once he even took my best bonnet, when I had gone away to my sick mother, and when I came back I found he had given it to the hen to lay her eggs in. And you know yourself that, only last week, when I sent him to buy a cask of butter, he returned driving a hundred and fifty ducks which someone had induced him to take, and not one of them would lay.\""\n\n\""Yes, I am afraid he IS trying,\"" replied the first; \""but let us put them to the proof, and see which of them is the most foolish.\"" So, about the time that she expected her husband home from work, she got out her spinning-wheel and sat busily turning it, taking care not even to look up from her work when the man came in. For some minutes he stood with his mouth open watching her, and as she still remained silent, he said at last, \""Have you gone mad, wife, that you sit spinning without anything on the wheel?\""\n\n\""YOU may think that there is nothing on it,\"" answered she, \""but I can assure you that there is a large skein of wool, so fine that nobody can see it, which will be woven into a coat for you.\"" \n\n\""Dear me!\"" he replied, \""what a clever wife I have got! If you had not told me I should never have known that there was any wool on the wheel at all. But now I really do seem to see something.\"" The woman smiled and was silent, and after spinning busily for an hour more, she got up from her stoop and began to weave as fast as she could. At last she got up and said to her husband, \""I am too tired to finish it to-night, so I shall go to bed, and to-morrow I shall only have the cutting and stitching to do.\""\n\nThe next morning she got up early, and after she had cleaned her house, fed her chickens, and put everything in its place again, she bent over the kitchen table, and the sound of her big scissors might be heard snip! snap! as far as the garden. Her husband could not see anything to snip at; but then he was so stupid that was not surprising! After the cutting came the sewing. The woman patted and pinned and fixed and joined, and then, turning to the man, she said, \""Now it is ready for you to try on.\"" And she made him take off his coat and stand up in front of her, and once more she patted and pinned and fixed and joined, and was very careful in smoothing out every wrinkle.\n\n\""It does not feel very warm,\"" observed the man at last, when he had borne all this patiently for a long time. \""That is because it is so fine,\"" answered she; \""you do not want it to be as thick as the rough clothes you wear every day.\"" He DID, but was ashamed to say so, and only answered, \""Well, I am sure it must be beautiful since you say so, and I shall be smarter than anyone in the whole village. 'What a splendid coat!' they will exclaim when they see me. But it is not everybody who has a wife as clever as mine.\""\n\nMeanwhile, the other wife was not idle. As soon as her husband entered, she looked at him with such a look of terror that the poor man was quite frightened. \""Why do you stare at me so? Is there anything the matter?\"" asked he. \""Oh! go to bed at once,\"" she cried; \""you must be very ill indeed to look like that!\"" The man was rather surprised at first, as he felt particularly well that evening; but the moment his wife spoke, he became quite certain that he had something dreadful the matter with him and grew quite pale.\n\n\""I dare say it would be the best place for me,\"" he answered, trembling; and he suffered his wife to take him upstairs and to help him off with his clothes. \""If you sleep well during the night there MAY be a chance for you,\"" said she, shaking her head, as she tucked him up warmly; \""but if not\u2014\"" And of course the poor man never closed an eye till the sun rose. \""How do you feel this morning?\"" asked the woman, coming in on tip-toe when her house-work was finished. \""Oh, bad; very bad indeed,\"" answered he; \""I have not slept for a moment. Can you think of nothing to make me better?\""\n\n\""I will try everything that is possible,\"" said the wife, who did not in the least wish her husband to die, but was determined to show that he was more foolish than the other man. \""I will get some dried herbs and make you a drink, but I am very much afraid that it is too late. Why did you not tell me before?\"" \""I thought perhaps the pain would go off in a day or two; and, besides, I did not want to make you unhappy,\"" answered the man, who was by this time quite sure he had been suffering tortures and had borne them like a hero. \""Of course, if I had had any idea how ill I really was, I should have spoken at once.\""\n\n\""Well, well, I will see what can be done,\"" said the wife, \""but talking is not good for you. Lie still, and keep yourself warm.\"" All that day the man lay in bed, and whenever his wife entered the room and asked him, with a shake of the head, how he felt, he always replied that he was getting worse. At last, in the evening, she burst into tears, and when he inquired what was the matter, she sobbed out, \""Oh, my poor, poor husband, are you really dead? I must go to-morrow and order your coffin.\""\n\nNow, when the man heard this, a cold shiver ran through his body, and all at once he knew that he was as well as he had ever been in his life. \""Oh, no, no!\"" he cried, \""I feel quite recovered! Indeed, I think I shall go out to work.\"" \""You will do no such thing,\"" replied his wife. \""Just keep quite quiet, for before the sun rises you will be a dead man.\"" The man was very frightened at her words and lay absolutely still while the undertaker came and measured him for his coffin; and his wife gave orders to the gravedigger about his grave.\n\nThat evening the coffin was sent home, and in the morning at nine o'clock the woman put him on a long flannel garment and called to the undertaker's men to fasten down the lid and carry him to the grave, where all their friends were waiting for them. Just as the body was being placed in the ground, the other woman's husband came running up, dressed, as far as anyone could see, in no clothes at all. Everybody burst into shouts of laughter at the sight of him, and the men laid down the coffin and laughed too, till their sides nearly split. The dead man was so astonished at this behaviour that he peeped out of a little window in the side of the coffin and cried out, \""I should laugh as loudly as any of you, if I were not a dead man.\""\n\nWhen they heard the voice coming from the coffin, the other people suddenly stopped laughing and stood as if they had been turned into stone. Then they rushed with one accord to the coffin and lifted the lid so that the man could step out amongst them. \""Were you really not dead after all?\"" asked they. \""And if not, why did you let yourself be buried?\"" At this, the wives both confessed that they had each wished to prove that her husband was stupider than the other. But the villagers declared that they could not decide which was the most foolish\u2014the man who allowed himself to be persuaded that he was wearing fine clothes when he was dressed in nothing, or the man who let himself be buried when he was alive and well.\n\nSo the women quarrelled just as much as they did before, and no one ever knew whose husband was the most foolish."""
34,A Legend Of Confucius,"""When Confucius came to the earth, the Kilin, that strange beast which is the prince of all four-footed animals, sought the child and spat out a jade whereon was written: \""Son of the Watercrystal you are destined to become an uncrowned king!\"" Confucius grew up, studied diligently, learned wisdom, and came to be a saint. He did much good on earth, and ever since his death has been reverenced as the greatest of teachers and masters. He had foreknowledge of many things, and even after he had died, he gave evidence of this.\n\nOnce, when the wicked Emperor Tsin Schi Huang had conquered all the other kingdoms and was traveling through the entire empire, he came to the homeland of Confucius. There, he found his grave and wished to have it opened to see what was inside. All his officials advised him against this, but he would not listen to them. A passage was dug into the grave, and in its main chamber, they found a coffin whose wood appeared to be quite fresh. When struck, it sounded like metal.\n\nTo the left of the coffin was a door that led into an inner chamber. In this chamber stood a bed, a table with books, and clothing, all as though meant for the use of a living person. Tsin Schi Huang seated himself on the bed and looked down. There, on the floor, stood two shoes of red silk, their tips adorned with a woven pattern of clouds. A bamboo staff leaned against the wall. The Emperor, in jest, put on the shoes, took the staff, and left the grave.\n\nHowever, as he did so, a tablet suddenly appeared before his eyes, inscribed with the following lines:\n\n    O'er kingdoms six Tsin Schi Huang his army led,\n    To ope my grave and find my humble bed;\n    He steals my shoes and takes my staff away\n    To reach Schakiu--and his last earthly day!\n\nTsin Schi Huang was much alarmed and had the grave closed again. But when he reached Schakiu, he fell ill with a hasty fever, of which he ultimately died."""
37,How Molo Stole The Lovely Rose Red,"""At the time when the Tang dynasty reigned over the Middle Kingdom, there were master swordsmen of various kinds. The first were the saints of the sword, capable of taking different shapes at will, their swords striking like lightning. Before their opponents realized they had been struck, their heads had already fallen. These master swordsmen were men of lofty mind, choosing not to engage lightly in the quarrels of the world. The second kind were the sword heroes, who slayed the unjust and aided the oppressed. They carried hidden daggers and leather bags, possessing magical abilities that allowed them to turn human heads into flowing water. They could fly over roofs and walk up walls, leaving no trace behind. The lowest sort were the mere bought slayers, who hired themselves out to those wishing to eliminate their enemies, treating death as an everyday matter.\n\nAmong these swordsmen was Old Dragonbeard, a master swordsman who stood midway between the first and second orders. However, the focus of this story is on Molo, a true sword hero. At that time, a young man named Tsui lived in the city. His father was a high official and a friend of the prince. One day, Tsui was sent to visit the ailing prince. Young, handsome, and gifted, he entered the prince's palace, where three beautiful slave girls greeted him. They presented him with rosy peaches in a golden bowl, pouring sugar over them. After enjoying the treat, Tsui took his leave, and the prince ordered one of the slave girls, Rose-Red, to escort him to the gate. As they walked, Tsui kept glancing back at her, and she smiled, making secret signs with her fingers. She stretched out three fingers, turned her hand around three times, and pointed to a little mirror on her breast. When they parted, she whispered, \""Do not forget me!\""\n\nUpon returning home, Tsui was lost in thought, sitting absent-mindedly like a wooden rooster. His old servant, Molo, noticed his distress and inquired about it. Tsui shared the events of the day and the signs Rose-Red had made. Molo interpreted her signs: the three fingers indicated she was quartered in the third court of the palace, the three turns of her hand meant the fifteenth day, and the mirror signified that he should come for her at midnight on that day. Tsui's spirits lifted, but soon he grew troubled again, pondering how he could possibly enter the prince's palace.\n\nMolo reassured him, saying it would be easy. On the fifteenth, they would wrap themselves in dark silk, and Molo would carry Tsui into the palace. However, he warned of a wild dog guarding the slave girl's court, strong and watchful. Molo declared that he alone could kill the dog. On the appointed day, Tsui provided Molo with meat and wine, and the old man took a chain-hammer, disappearing for a brief moment before returning to announce the dog was dead.\n\nAt midnight, they wrapped themselves in dark silk, and Molo carried Tsui over the tenfold walls surrounding the palace. They reached the third gateway, which stood ajar. Inside, they saw the glow of a lamp and heard Rose-Red sighing. Tsui entered the room, and after a long, searching look, Rose-Red seized his hand. She expressed her joy that he understood her signs and inquired about Molo's presence. After Tsui called Molo in, Rose-Red shared her plight, revealing that despite her luxurious surroundings, she felt like a slave. She begged Molo to help her escape, promising to serve Tsui as a slave in gratitude.\n\nMolo agreed to help. He first asked permission to carry away Rose-Red's belongings, and after three trips, he returned for her and Tsui. He flew them over the steep walls, unnoticed by the palace guards, and safely hid Rose-Red in a distant room at Tsui's home. When the prince discovered one of his slave girls was missing and that a wild dog had been killed, he suspected a powerful sword hero was involved. He ordered that the matter be kept secret while investigations were conducted.\n\nTwo years passed without incident, and Tsui had almost forgotten the danger. However, when spring arrived, Rose-Red ventured outside in a small wagon near the river, where one of the prince's servants spotted her. The prince summoned Tsui, who, unable to hide the truth, recounted the entire story. The prince declared that the blame lay with Rose-Red, but since she was now Tsui's wife, he would let the matter rest. However, Molo would have to face the consequences.\n\nThe prince ordered a hundred armored soldiers to surround Tsui's house and capture Molo. But Molo, armed with his dagger, flew up the high wall, evading the arrows that rained down upon him. In a moment, he vanished, leaving no trace behind. Years later, one of his former master's servants encountered him in the South, where he was selling medicine, and he looked exactly as he had a decade before."""
39,Old Dschang,"""Once upon a time, there was a man who went by the name of Old Dschang. He lived in the country, near Yangdschou, as a gardener. His neighbor, named Sir We, held an official position in Yangdschou. Sir We had decided that it was time for his daughter to marry, so he sent for a match-maker and commissioned her to find a suitable husband. Old Dschang heard this and was pleased. He prepared food and drink, entertained the match-maker, and told her to recommend him as a husband. However, the old match-maker went off scolding.\n\nThe next day, he invited her to dinner again and gave her money. The old match-maker said, \""You do not know what you wish! Why should a gentleman's beautiful daughter condescend to marry a poor old gardener like yourself? Even though you had money to burn, your white hair would not match her black locks. Such a marriage is out of the question!\"" But Old Dschang did not cease to entreat her: \""Make an attempt, just one attempt, to mention me! If they will not listen to you, then I must resign myself to my fate!\""\n\nThe old match-maker had taken his money, so she could not well refuse. Though she feared being scolded, she mentioned him to Sir We. He grew angry and wanted to throw her out of the house. \""I knew you would not thank me,\"" said she, \""but the old man urged it so that I could not refuse to mention his intention.\"" Sir We replied, \""Tell the old man that if this very day he brings me two white jade-stones and four hundred ounces of yellow gold, then I will give him my daughter's hand in marriage.\"" He only wished to mock the old man's folly, for he knew that the latter could not give him anything of the kind.\n\nThe match-maker went to Old Dschang and delivered the message. He made no objection but at once brought the exact quantity of gold and jewels to Sir We's house. The latter was very much frightened, and when his wife heard of it, she began to weep and wail loudly. But the girl encouraged her mother: \""My father has given his word now and cannot break it. I will know how to bear my fate.\"" So Sir We's daughter was married to Old Dschang. Even after the wedding, the latter did not give up his work as a gardener. He spaded the field and sold vegetables as usual, while his wife had to fetch water and build the kitchen fire herself. She did her work without false shame, and though her relatives reproached her, she continued to do so.\n\nOnce, an aristocratic relative visited Sir We and said, \""If you had really been poor, were there not enough young gentlemen in the neighborhood for your daughter? Why did you have to marry her to such a wrinkled old gardener? Now that you have thrown her away, so to speak, it would be better if both of them left this part of the country.\"" Then Sir We prepared a banquet and invited his daughter and Old Dschang to visit him. When they had had sufficient to eat and drink, he allowed them to get an inkling of what was in his mind.\n\nOld Dschang said, \""I have only remained here because I thought you would long for your daughter. But since you are tired of us, I will be glad to go. I have a little country house back in the hills, and we will set out for it early tomorrow morning.\"" The following morning, at break of dawn, Old Dschang came with his wife to say farewell. Sir We said, \""Should we long to see you at some later time, my son can make inquiries.\"" Old Dschang placed his wife on a donkey and gave her a straw hat to wear. He himself took his staff and walked after.\n\nA few years passed without any news from either of them. Then Sir We and his wife felt quite a longing to see their daughter and sent their son to make inquiries. When the latter got back in the hills, he met a plow-boy who was plowing with two yellow steers. He asked him, \""Where is Old Dschang's country house?\"" The plow-boy left the plow in the harrow, bowed, and answered, \""You have been a long time coming, sir! The village is not far from here: I will show you the way.\""\n\nThey crossed a hill. At the foot of the hill flowed a brook, and when they had crossed the brook, they had to climb another hill. Gradually the landscape changed. From the top of the hill, a valley could be seen, level in the middle, surrounded by abrupt crags and shaded by green trees, among which houses and towers peeped forth. This was the country house of Old Dschang. Before the village flowed a deep brook full of clear, blue water. They passed over a stone bridge and reached the gate. Here flowers and trees grew in luxurious profusion, and peacocks and cranes flew about. From the distance could be heard the sound of flutes and stringed instruments. Crystal-clear tones rose to the clouds. A messenger in a purple robe received the guest at the gate and led him into a hall of surpassing splendor. Strange fragrances filled the air, and there was a ringing of little bells of pearl. Two maid-servants came forth to greet him, followed by two rows of beautiful girls in a long processional. After them, a man in a flowing turban, clad in scarlet silk, with red slippers, came floating along. The guest saluted him. He was serious and dignified, and at the same time seemed youthfully fresh. At first, We's son did not recognize him, but when he looked more closely, it was Old Dschang! The latter said with a smile, \""I am pleased that the long road to travel has not prevented your coming. Your sister is just combing her hair. She will welcome you in a moment.\"" Then he had him sit down and drink tea.\n\nAfter a short time, a maid-servant came and led him to the inner rooms, to his sister. The beams of her room were of sandalwood, the doors of tortoise-shell, and the windows inlaid with blue jade; her curtains were formed of strings of pearls, and the steps leading into the room were of green nephrite. His sister was magnificently gowned and far more beautiful than before. She asked him carelessly how he was getting along and what her parents were doing, but was not very cordial. After a splendid meal, she had an apartment prepared for him.\n\n\""My sister wishes to make an excursion to the Mountain of the Fairies,\"" said Old Dschang to him. \""We will be back about sunset, and you can rest until we return.\"" Then many-colored clouds rose in the courtyard, and dulcet music sounded on the air. Old Dschang mounted a dragon, while his wife and sister rode on phenixes and their attendants on cranes. So they rose into the air and disappeared in an easterly direction. They did not return until after sunset.\n\nOld Dschang and his wife then said to him, \""This is an abode of the blessed. You cannot remain here overlong. Tomorrow we will escort you back.\"" On the following day, when taking leave, Old Dschang gave him eighty ounces of gold and an old straw hat. \""Should you need money,\"" said he, \""you can go to Yangdschou and inquire in the northern suburb for old Wang's drug-shop. There you can collect ten million pieces of copper. This hat is the order for them.\"" Then he ordered his plow-boy to take him home again.\n\nQuite a few of the folks at home, to whom he described his adventures, thought that Old Dschang must be a holy man, while others regarded the whole thing as a magic vision. After five or six years, Sir We's money came to an end. So his son took the straw hat to Yangdschou and there asked for old Wang. The latter just happened to be standing in his drug-shop, mixing herbs. When the son explained his errand, he said, \""The money is ready. But is your hat genuine?\"" He took the hat and examined it. A young girl came from an inner room and said, \""I wove the hat for Old Dschang myself. There must be a red thread in it.\"" And sure enough, there was. Then old Wang gave young We the ten million pieces of copper, and the latter now believed that Old Dschang was really a saint. So he once more went over the hills to look for him. He asked the forest-keepers, but they could tell him nothing. Sadly, he retraced his steps and decided to inquire of old Wang, but he had also disappeared.\n\nWhen several years had passed, he once more came to Yangdschou and was walking in the meadow before the city gate. There he met Old Dschang's plow-boy. The latter cried out, \""How are you? How are you?\"" and drew out ten pounds of gold, which he gave to him, saying, \""My mistress told me to give you this. My master is this very moment drinking tea with old Wang in the inn.\"" Young We followed the plow-boy, intending to greet his brother-in-law. But when he reached the inn, there was no one in sight. And when he turned around, the plow-boy had disappeared as well. Since that time, no one ever heard from Old Dschang again."""
40,The Bird With Nine Heads,"""Long, long ago, there once lived a king and a queen who had a daughter. One day, when the daughter went walking in the garden, a tremendous storm suddenly came up and carried her away with it. The storm had come from a bird with nine heads, who had robbed the princess and brought her to his cave. The king, unaware of his daughter's fate, proclaimed throughout the land: \""Whoever brings back the princess may have her for his bride!\""\n\nA youth had seen the bird as it carried the princess to his cave, which was situated in the middle of a sheer wall of rock. One could not climb up to it from below, nor could one climb down from above. As the youth walked around the rock, another youth approached and asked what he was doing there. The first youth explained that the bird with nine heads had taken the king's daughter to his cave. The second youth knew what he had to do; he called together his friends, and they lowered the first youth to the cave in a basket.\n\nUpon entering the cave, the youth saw the king's daughter sitting there, washing the wound of the bird with nine heads. The hound of heaven had bitten off his tenth head, and the wound was still bleeding. The princess motioned for the youth to hide, and he complied. After she had washed and bandaged the bird's wound, all nine of its heads fell asleep. The youth then stepped forth from his hiding place and cut off the remaining nine heads with a sword. However, the princess suggested, \""It would be best if you were hauled up first, and I came after.\""\n\n\""No,\"" replied the youth. \""I will wait below here until you are in safety.\"" Initially, the princess was reluctant, but eventually, she allowed herself to be persuaded and climbed into the basket. Before she did so, she took a long pin from her hair, broke it into two halves, and gave one half to him while keeping the other. She also divided her silken kerchief with him, instructing him to take good care of both gifts. Unfortunately, when the other man drew up the king's daughter, he took her away with him, leaving the youth in the cave despite his calls and pleas.\n\nLeft alone, the youth wandered around the cave and discovered several maidens who had been captured by the bird with nine heads and had perished from hunger. On the wall, he found a fish nailed to it with four nails. When he touched the fish, it transformed into a handsome youth who thanked him for his rescue, and they agreed to regard each other as brothers. Soon, the first youth grew hungry and stepped outside the cave to search for food, but only stones lay scattered around. Suddenly, he spotted a great dragon licking a stone. Imitating the dragon, he found his hunger vanished.\n\nThe youth then asked the dragon how he could escape the cave, and the dragon nodded toward his tail, indicating he should climb on. The youth did so, and in the blink of an eye, he was on the ground, while the dragon vanished. Continuing on his journey, he stumbled upon a tortoise-shell filled with beautiful pearls. These were magical pearls; if thrown into fire, the flames would cease to burn, and if thrown into water, the waters would part, allowing one to walk through.\n\nThe youth pocketed the pearls and soon reached the seashore. He tossed a pearl into the sea, and the waters parted, revealing the sea-dragon. The dragon exclaimed, \""Who is disturbing me here in my own kingdom?\"" The youth replied, \""I found pearls in a tortoise-shell and threw one into the sea, causing the waters to divide.\"" Recognizing him as the same dragon he had seen in the cave, the youth learned that the dragon was the father of the handsome youth he had saved.\n\n\""Since you have saved my son and become his brother, I am your father,\"" said the old dragon, and he treated the youth hospitably with food and wine. One day, the dragon's son advised him, \""My father will surely want to reward you. But accept no money or jewels; only the little gourd flask over yonder. With it, you can conjure whatever you wish.\"" When the old dragon asked the youth what he desired as a reward, he replied, \""I want no money or jewels. All I want is the little gourd flask.\""\n\nInitially reluctant, the dragon eventually agreed to give it to him. After leaving the dragon's castle, the youth felt hungry, and immediately a table appeared before him, laden with a fine meal. After eating, he grew weary and found an ass waiting for him. He mounted the ass, but soon found its gait too uneven. A wagon came along, and he climbed in, but it shook him up as well. Just as he wished for a litter, one appeared, and he settled into it. The bearers carried him to the city where the king, queen, and their daughter resided.\n\nMeanwhile, the other youth had returned with the king's daughter, and a wedding was planned. However, the princess was not willing, stating, \""He is not the right man. My true deliverer will come with half of the long pin from my hair and half of my silken kerchief as a token.\"" As time passed and the youth did not appear, the other suitor pressed the king, who grew impatient and declared, \""The wedding shall take place tomorrow!\"" The princess wandered through the city, searching for her true deliverer.\n\nOn the very day the litter arrived, the princess noticed the half of her silken handkerchief in the youth's hand. Filled with joy, she led him to her father. There, he revealed his half of the long pin, which fit perfectly with hers, convincing the king that he was indeed the rightful deliverer. The false bridegroom was punished, the wedding was celebrated, and the youth and the princess lived in peace and happiness until the end of their days."""
41,The Dragon Princess,"""In the Sea of Dungting, there is a hill, and within that hill lies a hole so deep that it has no bottom. One day, a fisherman passing by slipped and fell into this hole. He found himself in a strange country filled with winding paths that led over hills and dales for several miles. Eventually, he arrived at a dragon-castle situated in a vast plain, where a green slime grew up to his knees. Approaching the castle gate, he encountered a dragon that spouted water, dispersing it into a fine mist. Inside the gate, a small hornless dragon raised its head, displayed its claws, and refused him entry.\n\nThe fisherman spent several days in the cave, surviving on the green slime, which he discovered was edible and tasted like rice-mush. After some time, he managed to find a way out and reported his experience to the district mandarin, who in turn informed the emperor. The emperor summoned a wise man to inquire about the strange occurrence.\n\nThe wise man explained, \""There are four paths in this cave. One leads to the south-west shore of the Sea of Dungting, another to a valley in the land of the four rivers, the third ends in a cave on the mountain of Lo-Fu, and the fourth leads to an island in the Eastern Sea. In this cave resides the seventh daughter of the Dragon-King of the Eastern Sea, who guards his pearls and treasures. Long ago, a fisherboy dived into the water and retrieved a pearl from beneath a sleeping black dragon, which is why he was unharmed. The treasure the daughter guards consists of thousands of such jewels, watched over by small dragons. Dragons are averse to wax but are fond of beautiful jade-stones and kung-tsing wood, and they enjoy eating swallows. If a messenger were sent with a letter, it might be possible to obtain precious pearls.\""\n\nThe emperor was intrigued and announced a reward for anyone brave enough to act as his messenger to the dragon-castle. The first to step forward was a man named So Pi-Lo, but the wise man cautioned, \""Your great-great-great-great-grandfather once killed over a hundred dragons of the Eastern Sea and was ultimately slain by them. The dragons are your family's enemies, and you cannot go.\""\n\nNext, a man from Canton named Lo-Dsi-Tschun, along with his two brothers, claimed that their ancestors were related to the Dragon-King, making them well-liked by the dragons. They pleaded to be entrusted with the message. The wise man inquired, \""Do you still possess the stone that compels the dragons to obey you?\"" They replied affirmatively, but when the wise man examined the stone, he remarked, \""This stone only commands the dragons that create clouds and rain; it will not work on those guarding the pearls.\""\n\nHe further questioned them about the dragon-brain vapor, to which they admitted they did not have it. The wise man then suggested, \""On the Western Ocean, foreign merchants trade in dragon-brain vapor. Someone must seek it from them. I also know a holy man skilled in taming dragons who has prepared ten pounds of dragon-stone. We should send for that as well.\""\n\nThe emperor dispatched messengers who eventually met one of the holy man's disciples and obtained two fragments of dragon-stone. The wise man declared, \""This is what we need!\"" After several months, they secured a pill of dragon-brain vapor. The emperor was pleased and had his jewelers carve two small boxes from the finest jade, polished with Wutung-tree ashes. He also prepared two vases from the best hollowgreen wood, hardened with sea-fish lime. The bodies and clothing of the messengers were rubbed with tree-wax, and they were given five hundred roasted swallows for their journey.\n\nUpon entering the cave and reaching the dragon-castle, the little dragon guarding the gate caught the scent of the tree-wax and crouched down, allowing them to pass unharmed. They offered him a hundred roasted swallows as a bribe to announce their presence to the daughter of the Dragon-King. Once admitted, they presented her with the jade caskets, vases, and the remaining four hundred roasted swallows as gifts. The dragon's daughter received them graciously, and they unfolded the emperor's letter.\n\nIn the castle, there was an ancient dragon over a thousand years old who could transform into a human and interpret human language. Through him, the dragon's daughter learned of the emperor's gifts, and in return, she sent back three great pearls, seven smaller pearls, and a bushel of ordinary pearls. The messengers took their leave, riding on a dragon's back, and swiftly reached the banks of the Yangtze-kiang. They made their way to Nanking, the imperial capital, where they presented their treasure to the emperor.\n\nThe emperor was delighted and showed the pearls to the wise man, who explained, \""Of the three great pearls, one is a divine wishing-pearl of the third class, and two are black dragon-pearls of medium quality. Among the seven smaller pearls, two are serpent-pearls, and five are mussel-pearls. The remaining pearls consist of sea-crane pearls, snail, and oyster-pearls. While they do not match the great pearls in value, few can equal them on earth.\""\n\nThe emperor displayed the pearls to his servants, but they dismissed the wise man's words as mere talk. The wise man then elaborated, \""The radiance of wishing-pearls of the first class can be seen for forty miles, the second class for twenty miles, and the third for ten miles. Within their radiance, no wind, rain, thunder, lightning, water, fire, or weapons can reach. The black dragon-pearls glow with nine colors at night, and within their light, the poison of serpents and worms is rendered powerless. The serpent-pearls are seven-colored, and the mussel-pearls are five-colored, both shining at night. The best pearls are those most free from spots, growing within the mussel and changing size with the moon's phases.\""\n\nSomeone inquired how to distinguish between the serpent and sea-crane pearls, and the wise man replied, \""The animals themselves recognize them.\"" To demonstrate, the emperor selected a serpent-pearl and a sea-crane pearl, placed them alongside a bushel of ordinary pearls in the courtyard, and summoned a large yellow serpent and a black crane. The crane immediately picked up a sea-crane pearl and began to dance and sing, while the serpent coiled around the serpent-pearl. Witnessing this, the people acknowledged the truth of the wise man's words, and the radiance of the pearls confirmed his claims.\n\nIn the dragon-castle, the messengers had enjoyed exquisite food that tasted like flowers, herbs, ointment, and sugar. They brought back a remnant of this delicacy, but it hardened into stone when exposed to air. The emperor ordered these fragments to be preserved in the treasury. He then honored the three brothers with high ranks and titles, gifting each of them a thousand rolls of fine silk. Additionally, he investigated why the fisherman had not been harmed by the dragons when he stumbled upon the cave. It was discovered that his fishing clothes had been soaked in oil and tree-wax, which the dragons had dreaded due to the odor."""
44,The King Of The Ants,"""Once upon a time, there was a scholar who wandered away from his home and ventured to Emmet village. In this village stood a house that was said to be haunted, yet it was beautifully situated and surrounded by a lovely garden. Intrigued, the scholar decided to hire the house. One evening, as he sat engrossed in his books, he was suddenly startled by the arrival of several hundred tiny knights galloping into the room. Their horses were no larger than flies, and they were accompanied by hunting falcons and dogs that resembled gnats and fleas.\n\nThe tiny knights made their way to the scholar's bed in the corner of the room, where they held a grand hunt with bows and arrows. The scholar watched in amazement as they caught a tremendous quantity of birds and game, all of which were no larger than grains of rice. Once the hunt concluded, a long procession entered the room, adorned with banners and standards. The knights wore swords at their sides and bore spears in their hands, halting in the north-west corner of the room. Following them were several hundred serving-men, who brought curtains, covers, tents, pots, kettles, cups, plates, tables, and chairs. An additional group of servants scurried about, guarding the roads and carrying messages.\n\nAs the scholar gradually accustomed himself to the sight, he noticed a brightly colored banner approaching. Behind it rode a personage clad in a scarlet hat and purple garments, surrounded by an escort of thousands. Runners with whips and rods cleared the way for him. Suddenly, a man wearing an iron helmet and wielding a golden ax cried out, \""His Highness is graciously pleased to look at the fish in the Purple Lake!\"" The man in the scarlet hat dismounted and, followed by several hundred men, approached the saucer that the scholar used for his writing ink. Tents were erected on the edge of the saucer, and a lavish banquet was prepared. Guests sat down at the table, while musicians and dancers stood ready, creating a vibrant scene filled with mingled garments of purple, scarlet, crimson, and green. The faint melodies of pipes, flutes, fiddles, and cymbals filled the air, and the conversations at the table were distinctly audible.\n\nAfter three courses, the man in the scarlet hat commanded, \""Quick! Make ready the nets and lines for fishing!\"" Immediately, nets were cast into the saucer, and hundreds of thousands of fish were caught. The man in the scarlet hat, content with his catch, cast a line into the shallow waters of the saucer and caught a baker's dozen of red carp. He then ordered the head cook to prepare the fish, and the aroma of roasting fat and spices wafted throughout the room.\n\nIn a moment of arrogance, the wearer of the scarlet hat decided to amuse himself at the scholar's expense. He pointed at the scholar and proclaimed, \""I know nothing at all about the writings and customs of the saints and wise men, and yet I am a king who is highly honored! That scholar spends his whole life toiling over his books and remains poor and unaccomplished. If he could make up his mind to serve me faithfully as one of my officials, I might allow him to partake of our meal.\""\n\nThis insult angered the scholar. In a fit of rage, he took his book and struck at the tiny knights, causing them to scatter and wriggle out of the door. Determined to uncover the truth, he followed them and dug up the earth where they had disappeared. To his astonishment, he discovered an ants' nest as large as a barrel, teeming with countless green ants. In a fit of vengeance, the scholar built a large fire and smoked them out, determined to reclaim his peace and dignity."""
47,The Queen Of Heaven,"""The Queen of Heaven, also known as the Holy Mother, was once a maiden named Lin from Fukien. She lived a life marked by purity, reverence, and piety, passing away at the tender age of seventeen. Her spirit, however, transcended her mortal existence, and she became a powerful figure on the seas, earning the devotion of seamen who worship her. In times of peril, when they are beset by fierce winds and tumultuous waves, they call upon her, and she is always ready to hear their pleas.\n\nFukien is home to many seamen, and each year, countless lives are lost at sea. It is likely that the Queen of Heaven, during her earthly life, felt deep compassion for her people\u2019s suffering. This empathy has continued in her divine form, as she frequently appears on the seas to aid those in distress. On every ship that sets sail, a picture of the Queen of Heaven is displayed in the cabin, accompanied by three paper talismans. The first talisman depicts her with a crown and scepter, the second shows her as a maiden in ordinary dress, and the third portrays her with flowing hair, barefoot, and wielding a sword. When danger looms, the first talisman is burned, and if that fails, the second and then the third are used. If all efforts prove fruitless, the seamen resign themselves to fate.\n\nWhen seamen lose their way amidst the chaos of wind, waves, and dark clouds, they pray fervently to the Queen of Heaven. In response, a red lantern often appears on the water\u2019s surface, guiding them to safety. The Queen may also be seen in the skies, wielding her sword to part the winds, causing them to retreat to the North and South, calming the tumultuous waves. A wooden wand is kept before her holy picture in the cabin, serving as a protective charm against the fish-dragons\u2014two colossal fish that create chaos in the seas. When these dragons play, they obscure the sun and plunge the waters into darkness. If a ship can navigate toward a bright opening in the gloom, it will emerge into calm waters, having passed beneath the jaws of the dragons. To ward off danger, seamen burn paper or wool, or the Master of the Wand may burn incense and swing the wand over the water, causing the dragons to retreat.\n\nThe ashes from the censer can also serve as a warning; if they rise and scatter unexpectedly, it signifies impending danger. Nearly two hundred years ago, an army was assembled to conquer the island of Formosa. As the captain\u2019s banner was dedicated with the blood of a white horse, the Queen of Heaven appeared at the tip of the banner-staff, vanishing just as quickly, yet the invasion proved successful.\n\nIn another notable event during the reign of Kien Lung, Minister Dschou Ling was tasked with installing a new king in the Liu-Kiu Islands. While sailing south of Korea, his ship was caught in a violent storm and was drawn toward the infamous Black Whirlpool, a place from which no man had ever returned. As despair gripped the crew, a multitude of lights resembling red lanterns appeared on the water\u2019s surface. Overjoyed, the seamen prayed fervently, believing the Holy Mother had come to their rescue. Miraculously, a beautiful maiden adorned with golden earrings appeared, calming the winds and smoothing the waves. It felt as though a mighty hand was guiding the ship, which soon escaped the clutches of the Black Whirlpool.\n\nUpon his return, Dschou Ling recounted this miraculous event and advocated for the construction of temples in honor of the Queen of Heaven, urging that she be recognized among the pantheon of gods. The emperor granted his request, leading to the establishment of temples dedicated to the Queen of Heaven in all sea-port towns. Her birthday is now celebrated on the eighth day of the fourth month with grand spectacles and sacrifices, honoring her enduring legacy and the protection she offers to those who traverse the seas."""
48,The Two Scholars,"""Once upon a time, there were two scholars named Liu Tschen and Yuan Dschau. Both were young and handsome, and one spring day, they ventured into the hills of Tian Tai to gather curative herbs. As they explored, they stumbled upon a little valley where peach trees blossomed luxuriantly on either side. In the middle of the valley stood a cave, where two maidens, one clad in red garments and the other in green, beckoned to them with their hands. The maidens were beautiful beyond all telling.\n\nThe maidens greeted the scholars, saying, \""And have you come? We have been waiting for you overlong!\"" They led Liu and Yuan into the cave, where they served them tea and wine. The maiden in the red gown declared, \""I have been destined for the lord Liu,\"" while her sister announced, \""and my sister is for the lord Yuan!\"" Thus, the two scholars were married, and they spent their days gazing at the flowers or playing chess, completely forgetting the mundane world around them. They only occasionally noticed the peach blossoms opening and falling from the trees, and they marveled at the sudden changes in temperature that required them to change their clothing.\n\nOne day, however, the scholars were suddenly overcome by homesickness. The maidens, already aware of their feelings, said, \""When our lords have once been seized with homesickness, then we may hold them no longer.\"" The following day, the maidens prepared a farewell banquet, giving the scholars magic wine to take along with them, and said, \""We will see one another again. Now go your way!\"" With tears in their eyes, the scholars bade them farewell.\n\nUpon returning home, Liu and Yuan found that the gates and doors had long since vanished, and the villagers were all strangers to them. The villagers crowded around and asked who they might be. \""We are Liu Tschen and Yuan Dschau. Only a few days ago, we went into the hills to pick herbs!\"" A servant then rushed up, recognizing Liu and falling at his feet with joy. \""Yes, you are really my master! Since you went away, and we had no news of you, some seventy years or more have passed.\""\n\nThe servant led Liu through a high gateway adorned with bosses and a ring in a lion's mouth, customary for those of high estate. Inside, an old lady with white hair and a bent back approached, asking, \""What man is this?\"" The servant replied, \""Our master has returned again.\"" Turning to Liu, he added, \""That is the mistress. She is nearly a hundred years old, but fortunately is still strong and in good health.\"" Tears of joy and sadness filled the old lady's eyes as she exclaimed, \""Since you went away among the immortals, I had thought that we should never see each other again in this life. What great good fortune that you should have returned after all!\""\n\nAs the family gathered around Liu, he was overwhelmed with emotion. The tiny boy who had been in his home when he disappeared was now an old man of eighty, having served the empire in a high office. Liu learned that he had grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and even great-great-grandchildren, all of whom came to welcome him home. Filled with joy, Liu prepared a family banquet in the hall, where all his descendants sat around him in a circle. Despite the years that had passed, Liu still looked like a youth of twenty, causing laughter among the younger members of the family.\n\nDuring the banquet, Liu proclaimed, \""I have a means of driving away old age!\"" He produced his magic wine and offered it to his wife. After she drank three glasses, her white hair turned black, her wrinkles disappeared, and she transformed into a beautiful young woman. His son and older grandchildren eagerly requested the wine, and each one who drank even a drop was turned from an old man into a youth. The tale of Liu's magic wine spread, eventually reaching the emperor's ears. The emperor wished to summon Liu to his court, but Liu graciously declined. Instead, he sent the emperor some of his magic wine as a gift, which pleased the emperor greatly. In return, the emperor honored Liu with a tablet inscribed, \""The Common Home of Five Generations,\"" along with three signs he had written himself, signifying \""Joy in longevity.\""\n\nIn contrast, Yuan Dschau was not as fortunate. When he returned home, he discovered that his wife and child had long since passed away, and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren were mostly useless. Disheartened, he did not stay long and decided to return to the hills. Liu Tschen, however, remained with his family for several years. Eventually, he took his wife with him back to the Tai Hills, and they were never seen again."""
51,Cinderella Or The Little Glass Slipper,"""Once there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen. She had, by a former husband, two daughters of her own humor, who were, indeed, exactly like her in all things. He had likewise, by another wife, a young daughter, but of unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper, which she took from her mother, who was the best creature in the world.\n\nNo sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding over than the mother-in-law began to show herself in her true colors. She could not bear the good qualities of this pretty girl, and the less because they made her own daughters appear the more odious. She employed her in the meanest work of the house: she scoured the dishes, tables, etc., and scrubbed madam's chamber, and those of misses, her daughters. She lay up in a sorry garret, upon a wretched straw bed, while her sisters lay in fine rooms, with floors all inlaid, upon beds of the very newest fashion, and where they had looking-glasses so large that they might see themselves at their full length from head to foot.\n\nThe poor girl bore all patiently and dared not tell her father, who would have rattled her off; for his wife governed him entirely. When she had done her work, she used to go into the chimney-corner and sit down among cinders and ashes, which made her commonly be called Cinderwench; but the youngest, who was not so rude and uncivil as the eldest, called her Cinderella. However, Cinderella, notwithstanding her mean apparel, was a hundred times handsomer than her sisters, though they were always dressed very richly.\n\nIt happened that the King's son gave a ball and invited all persons of fashion to it. Our young misses were also invited, for they cut a very grand figure among the quality. They were mightily delighted at this invitation and wonderfully busy in choosing out such gowns, petticoats, and head-clothes as might become them. This was a new trouble to Cinderella, for it was she who ironed her sisters' linen and plaited their ruffles; they talked all day long of nothing but how they should be dressed.\n\n\""For my part,\"" said the eldest, \""I will wear my red velvet suit with French trimming.\"" \n\n\""And I,\"" said the youngest, \""shall have my usual petticoat; but then, to make amends for that, I will put on my gold-flowered manteau and my diamond stomacher, which is far from being the most ordinary one in the world.\""\n\nThey sent for the best tire-woman they could get to make up their head-dresses and adjust their double pinners, and they had their red brushes and patches from Mademoiselle de la Poche.\n\nCinderella was likewise called up to them to be consulted in all these matters, for she had excellent notions and advised them always for the best, nay, and offered her services to dress their heads, which they were very willing she should do. As she was doing this, they said to her:\n\n\""Cinderella, would you not be glad to go to the ball?\""\n\n\""Alas!\"" said she, \""you only jeer me; it is not for such as I am to go there.\""\n\n\""You are in the right of it,\"" replied they; \""it would make the people laugh to see a Cinderwench at a ball.\""\n\nAnyone but Cinderella would have dressed their heads awry, but she was very good and dressed them perfectly well. They were almost two days without eating, so much were they transported with joy. They broke above a dozen laces in trying to be laced up close, that they might have a fine slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass. At last, the happy day came; they went to Court, and Cinderella followed them with her eyes as long as she could, and when she had lost sight of them, she fell a-crying.\n\nHer godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked her what was the matter.\n\n\""I wish I could\u2014I wish I could\u2014\""; she was not able to speak the rest, being interrupted by her tears and sobbing.\n\nThis godmother of hers, who was a fairy, said to her, \""You wish you could go to the ball; is it not so?\""\n\n\""Y-es,\"" cried Cinderella, with a great sigh.\n\n\""Well,\"" said her godmother, \""be but a good girl, and I will contrive that you shall go.\"" Then she took her into her chamber and said to her, \""Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin.\""\n\nCinderella went immediately to gather the finest she could get and brought it to her godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin could make her go to the ball. Her godmother scooped out all the inside of it, having left nothing but the rind; which done, she struck it with her wand, and the pumpkin was instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded all over with gold.\n\nShe then went to look into her mouse-trap, where she found six mice, all alive, and ordered Cinderella to lift up a little the trapdoor, when, giving each mouse, as it went out, a little tap with her wand, the mouse was that moment turned into a fine horse, which altogether made a very fine set of six horses of a beautiful mouse-colored dapple-gray. Being at a loss for a coachman, Cinderella said, \""I will go and see if there is never a rat in the rat-trap\u2014we may make a coachman of him.\""\n\n\""You are in the right,\"" replied her godmother; \""go and look.\""\n\nCinderella brought the trap to her, and in it there were three huge rats. The fairy made choice of one of the three which had the largest beard, and, having touched him with her wand, he was turned into a fat, jolly coachman, who had the smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld. After that, she said to her:\n\n\""Go again into the garden, and you will find six lizards behind the watering-pot; bring them to me.\""\n\nShe had no sooner done so but her godmother turned them into six footmen, who skipped up immediately behind the coach, with their liveries all bedaubed with gold and silver, and clung as close behind each other as if they had done nothing else their whole lives. The Fairy then said to Cinderella:\n\n\""Well, you see here an equipage fit to go to the ball with; are you not pleased with it?\""\n\n\""Oh! yes,\"" cried she; \""but must I go there as I am, in these nasty rags?\""\n\nHer godmother only just touched her with her wand, and, at the same instant, her clothes were turned into cloth of gold and silver, all beset with jewels. This done, she gave her a pair of glass slippers, the prettiest in the whole world. Being thus decked out, she got up into her coach; but her godmother, above all things, commanded her not to stay till after midnight, telling her, at the same time, that if she stayed one moment longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again, her horses mice, her coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and her clothes become just as they were before.\n\nShe promised her godmother she would not fail of leaving the ball before midnight; and then away she drives, scarce able to contain herself for joy. The King's son, who was told that a great princess, whom nobody knew, was come, ran out to receive her; he gave her his hand as she alighted out of the coach and led her into the ball, among all the company. There was immediately a profound silence; they left off dancing, and the violins ceased to play, so attentive was everyone to contemplate the singular beauties of the unknown new-comer. Nothing was then heard but a confused noise of:\n\n\""Ha! how handsome she is! Ha! how handsome she is!\""\n\nThe King himself, old as he was, could not help watching her and telling the Queen softly that it was a long time since he had seen so beautiful and lovely a creature.\n\nAll the ladies were busied in considering her clothes and headdress, that they might have some made next day after the same pattern, provided they could meet with such fine material and as able hands to make them.\n\nThe King's son conducted her to the most honorable seat and afterward took her out to dance with him; she danced so very gracefully that they all more and more admired her. A fine collation was served up, whereof the young prince ate not a morsel, so intently was he busied in gazing on her.\n\nShe went and sat down by her sisters, showing them a thousand civilities, giving them part of the oranges and citrons which the Prince had presented her with, which very much surprised them, for they did not know her. While Cinderella was thus amusing her sisters, she heard the clock strike eleven and three-quarters, whereupon she immediately made a courtesy to the company and hasted away as fast as she could.\n\nWhen she got home, she ran to seek out her godmother, and, after having thanked her, she said she could not but heartily wish she might go next day to the ball, because the King's son had desired her.\n\nAs she was eagerly telling her godmother whatever had passed at the ball, her two sisters knocked at the door, which Cinderella ran and opened.\n\n\""How long you have stayed!\"" cried she, gaping, rubbing her eyes, and stretching herself as if she had been just waked out of her sleep; she had not, however, any manner of inclination to sleep since they went from home.\n\n\""If you had been at the ball,\"" said one of her sisters, \""you would not have been tired with it. There came there the finest princess, the most beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes; she showed us a thousand civilities and gave us oranges and citrons.\""\n\nCinderella seemed very indifferent in the matter; indeed, she asked them the name of that princess, but they told her they did not know it, and that the King's son was very uneasy on her account and would give all the world to know who she was. At this, Cinderella, smiling, replied:\n\n\""She must, then, be very beautiful indeed; how happy you have been! Could not I see her? Ah! dear Miss Charlotte, do lend me your yellow suit of clothes which you wear every day.\""\n\n\""Ay, to be sure!\"" cried Miss Charlotte; \""lend my clothes to such a dirty Cinderwench as you are! I should be a fool.\""\n\nCinderella, indeed, expected well such an answer and was very glad of the refusal; for she would have been sadly put to it if her sister had lent her what she asked for jestingly.\n\nThe next day the two sisters were at the ball, and so was Cinderella, but dressed more magnificently than before. The King's son was always by her and never ceased his compliments and kind speeches to her; to whom all this was so far from being tiresome that she quite forgot what her godmother had recommended to her; so that she, at last, counted the clock striking twelve when she took it to be no more than eleven. She then rose up and fled, as nimble as a deer. The Prince followed, but could not overtake her. She left behind one of her glass slippers, which the Prince took up most carefully. She got home but quite out of breath, and in her nasty old clothes, having nothing left her of all her finery but one of the little slippers, fellow to that she dropped. The guards at the palace gate were asked if they had not seen a princess go out, who said: They had seen nobody go out but a young girl, very meanly dressed, and who had more the air of a poor country wench than a gentlewoman.\n\nWhen the two sisters returned from the ball, Cinderella asked them if they had been well diverted and if the fine lady had been there. They told her: Yes, but that she hurried away immediately when it struck twelve, and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass slippers, the prettiest in the world, which the King's son had taken up; that he had done nothing but look at her all the time at the ball, and that most certainly he was very much in love with the beautiful person who owned the glass slipper.\n\nWhat they said was very true; for a few days after, the King's son caused it to be proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that he would marry her whose foot the slipper would just fit. They whom he employed began to try it upon the princesses, then the duchesses and all the Court, but in vain; it was brought to the two sisters, who did all they possibly could to thrust their foot into the slipper, but they could not effect it. Cinderella, who saw all this and knew her slipper, said to them, laughing:\n\n\""Let me see if it will not fit me.\""\n\nHer sisters burst out a-laughing and began to banter her. The gentleman who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and, finding her very handsome, said it was but just that she should try, and that he had orders to let everyone make trial.\n\nHe obliged Cinderella to sit down, and, putting the slipper to her foot, he found it went on very easily and fitted her as if it had been made of wax. The astonishment her two sisters were in was excessively great, but still abundantly greater when Cinderella pulled out of her pocket the other slipper and put it on her foot. Thereupon, in came her godmother, who, having touched with her wand Cinderella's clothes, made them richer and more magnificent than any of those she had before.\n\nAnd now her two sisters found her to be that fine, beautiful lady whom they had seen at the ball. They threw themselves at her feet to beg pardon for all the ill-treatment they had made her undergo. Cinderella took them up, and, as she embraced them, cried that she forgave them with all her heart and desired them always to love her.\n\nShe was conducted to the young prince, dressed as she was; he thought her more charming than ever, and, a few days after, married her. Cinderella, who was no less good than beautiful, gave her two sisters lodgings in the palace, and that very same day matched them with two great lords of the Court."""
56,Little Miss Muffet,"""Little Miss Muffet's father was a big banker in a big city, and he had so much money that the house he lived in was almost as beautiful as a king's palace. It was built of granite and marble, and richly furnished with every luxury that money can buy. There was an army of servants about the house, and many of them had no other duties than to wait upon Miss Muffet, for the little girl was an only child and therefore a personage of great importance. She had a maid to dress her hair and a maid to bathe her, a maid to serve her at table and a maid to tie her shoestrings, and several maids beside. And then there was Nurse Holloweg to look after all the maids and see they did their tasks properly.\n\nThe child's father spent his days at his office and his evenings at his club; her mother was a leader in society, and therefore fully engaged from morning till night and from night till morn; so that Little Miss Muffet seldom saw her parents and scarce knew them when she did see them. I have never known by what name she was christened. Perhaps she did not know herself, for everyone had called her \""Miss Muffet\"" since she could remember. The servants spoke of her respectfully as Miss Muffet. Mrs. Muffet would say, at times, \""By the way, Nurse, how is Miss Muffet getting along?\"" And Mr. Muffet, when he met his little daughter by chance on the walk or in the hallway, would stop and look at her gravely and say, \""So this is Miss Muffet. Well, how are you feeling, little one?\"" And then, without heeding her answer, he would walk away.\n\nPerhaps you think that Miss Muffet, surrounded by every luxury and with a dozen servants to wait upon her, was happy and contented; but such was not the case. She wanted to run and romp, but they told her it was unladylike; she wished to play with other children, but none were rich enough to be proper associates for her; she longed to dig in the dirt in the garden, but Nurse Holloweg was shocked at the very thought. So Miss Muffet became sullen and irritable, scolded everyone about her, and lived a very unhappy life. Her food was too rich and gave her dyspepsia, so that she grew thin and pale and did not sleep well at night.\n\nOne afternoon, her mother, who happened to be at home for an hour, suddenly thought of her little daughter; so she rang the bell and asked for Nurse Holloweg. \""How is Miss Muffet, Nurse?\"" enquired the lady. \""Very badly, ma'am,\"" was the reply. \""Badly! What do you mean? Is she ill?\"" \""She's far from well, ma'am,\"" answered the Nurse, \""and seems to be getting worse every day.\"" \""Well,\"" replied the lady; \""you must have the doctor to see her; and don't forget to let me know what he says. That is all, Nurse.\"" She turned to her novel again, and the Nurse walked away and sent a servant for the doctor. That great man, when he came, shook his head solemnly and said, \""She must have a change. Take her away into the country as soon as possible.\""\n\n\""And very good advice it was, too,\"" remarked the Nurse to one of the maids; \""for I feel as if I needed a change myself.\"" When she reported the matter to Mrs. Muffet, the mother answered, \""Very well; I will see Mr. Muffet and have him write out a cheque.\"" And so it was that a week later Little Miss Muffet went to the country, or rather to a small town where there was a summer hotel that had been highly recommended to Nurse Holloweg; and with her went the string of maids and a wagon-load of boxes and trunks.\n\nThe morning after their arrival, the little girl asked to go out upon the lawn. \""Well,\"" replied Nurse Holloweg, \""Sarah can take you out for half an hour. But remember you are not to run and get heated, for that will ruin your complexion; and you must not speak to any of the common children you meet, for your mother would object; and you must not get your shoes dusty nor your dress soiled, nor disobey Sarah in any way.\"" Little Miss Muffet went out in a very angry and sulky mood. \""What's the use of being in the country,\"" she thought, \""if I must act just as I did in the city? I hate Nurse Holloweg, and Sarah, and all the rest of them! and if I dared I'd just\u2014just run away.\""\n\nIndeed, a few minutes later, when Sarah had fallen asleep upon a bench under a big shade tree, Miss Muffet decided she would really run away for once in her life and see how it seemed. There was a pretty lane nearby, running between shady trees far out into the country, and, stealing softly away from Sarah's side, the little girl ran as fast as she could go, and never stopped until she was all out of breath. While she rested and wondered what she could do next, a farmer came along, driving an empty cart. \""I'll catch on behind,\"" said Miss Muffet, gleefully, \""just as I've seen the boys do in the city. Won't it be fun!\"" So she ran and caught on the end of the cart, and actually climbed into it, falling all in a heap upon the straw that lay upon the bottom. But it didn't hurt her at all, and the next minute the farmer whipped up his horses, and they went trotting along the lane, carrying Miss Muffet farther and farther away from hated Nurse Holloweg and the dreadful maids.\n\nShe looked around upon the green fields and the waving grain, and drew in deep breaths of the fresh country air, and was happy for almost the first time in her little life. By and by she lay back upon the straw and fell asleep; and the farmer, who did not know she was in his cart, drove on for many miles, until at last he stopped at a small wooden farmhouse and jumped to the ground. A woman came to the door to greet him, and he said to her, \""Well, mother, we're home again.\"" \""So I see,\"" she answered; \""but did you bring my groceries?\"" \""Yes,\"" he replied, as he began to unharness the horses; \""they are in the cart.\"" So she came to the cart and looked within, and saw Miss Muffet, who was still asleep.\n\n\""Where did you get the little girl?\"" asked the farmer's wife, in surprise. \""What little girl?\"" asked he. \""The one in the cart.\"" He came to the cart and looked in, and was as surprised as his wife. \""She must have climbed into the cart when I left the town,\"" he said; \""but waken her, wife, and we will hear what she has to say.\"" So the farmer's wife shook the girl by the arm, and Miss Muffet sat up in the cart and rubbed her eyes, wondering where she was. \""How came you in my cart?\"" asked the farmer. \""I caught on behind, and climbed in,\"" answered the girl. \""What is your name, and where do you live?\"" enquired the farmer's wife. \""My name is Miss Muffet, and I live in a big city\u2014but where, I do not know.\"" And that was all she could tell them, so the woman said at last, \""We must keep her till someone comes to claim her, and she can earn her living by helping me make the cheeses.\""\n\n\""That will be nice,\"" said Miss Muffet, with a laugh, \""for Nurse Holloweg never lets me do anything, and I should like to help somebody do something.\"" So they led her into the house, where the farmer's wife wondered at the fine texture of her dress and admired the golden chain that hung around her neck. \""Someone will surely come for her,\"" the woman said to her husband, \""for she is richly dressed and must belong to a family of some importance.\"" Nevertheless, when they had eaten dinner, for which Little Miss Muffet had a wonderful appetite, the woman took her into the dairy and told her how she could assist her in curdling the milk and preparing it for the cheese-press.\n\n\""Why, it's really fun to work,\"" said the girl, at first, \""and I should like to live here always. I do hope Nurse Holloweg will not find me.\"" After a time, however, she grew weary and wanted to rest; but the woman had not yet finished her cheese-making, so she bade the girl keep at her tasks. \""It's time enough to rest when the work is done,\"" she said, \""and if you stay with me you must earn your board. No one is allowed to idle in this house.\"" So Little Miss Muffet, though she felt like crying and was very tired, kept at her work until at length all was finished and the last cheese was in the press.\n\n\""Now,\"" said the farmer's wife, \""since you have worked so well I shall give you a dish of curds and whey for your supper, and you may go out into the orchard and eat it under the shade of the trees.\"" Little Miss Muffet had never eaten curds and whey before and did not know how they tasted; but she was very hungry, so she took the dish and went into the orchard. She first looked around for a place to sit down, and finally discovered a little grassy mound, which is called a tuffet in the country, and seated herself upon it. Then she tasted the curds and whey and found them very good.\n\nBut while she was eating, she chanced to look down at her feet, and there was a great black spider coming straight towards her. The girl had never seen such an enormous and hideous-looking spider before, and she was so frightened that she gave a scream and tipped backward off the tuffet, spilling the curds and whey all over her dress as she did so. This frightened her more than ever, and as soon as she could get upon her feet, she scampered away to the farmhouse as fast as she could go, crying bitterly as she ran. The farmer's wife tried to comfort her, and Miss Muffet, between her sobs, said she had seen \""the awfulest, biggest, blackest spider in all the world!\"" This made the woman laugh, for she was not afraid of spiders.\n\nSoon after, they heard a sound of wheels upon the road, and a handsome carriage came dashing up to the gate. \""Has anyone seen a little girl who has run away?\"" asked Nurse Holloweg, leaning out of the carriage. \""Oh, yes,\"" answered Little Miss Muffet; \""here I am, Nurse.\"" And she ran out and jumped into the carriage, for she was very glad to get back again to those who would care for her and not ask her to work making cheeses.\n\nWhen they were driving back to the town, the Nurse said, \""You must promise me, Miss Muffet, never to run away again. You have frightened me nearly into hysterics, and had you been lost your mother would have been quite disappointed.\"" The little girl was silent for a time; then she answered, \""I will promise not to run away if you will let me play as other children do. But if you do not allow me to run and romp and dig in the ground, I shall keep running away, no matter how many horrid spiders come to frighten me!\"" And Nurse Holloweg, who had really been much alarmed at so nearly losing her precious charge, thought it wise to agree to Miss Muffet's terms.\n\nShe kept her word, too, and when Little Miss Muffet went back to her home in the city, her cheeks were as red as roses and her eyes sparkled with health. She grew, in time, to be a beautiful young lady, and as healthy and robust as she was beautiful. Seeing which, the doctor put an extra large fee in his bill for advising that the little girl be taken to the country; and Mr. Muffet paid it without a word of protest. Even after Miss Muffet grew up and was married, she never forgot the day that she ran away, nor the curds and whey she ate for her supper, nor the great spider that frightened her away from the tuffet."""
59,Princess Bella Flor,"""Once upon a time, there lived a man who had two sons. When they grew up, the elder went to seek his fortune in a far country, and for many years, no one heard anything about him. Meanwhile, the younger son stayed at home with his father, who eventually died in a good old age, leaving great riches behind him.\n\nFor some time, the son who stayed at home spent his father's wealth freely, believing that he alone remained to enjoy it. But one day, as he was coming down the stairs, he was surprised to see a stranger enter the hall, looking about as if the house belonged to him. \""Have you forgotten me?\"" asked the man. \""I can't forget a person I have never known,\"" was the rude answer. \""I am your brother,\"" replied the stranger, \""and I have returned home without the money I hoped to have made. And, what is worse, they tell me in the village that my father is dead. I would have counted my lost gold as nothing if I could have seen him once more.\"" \n\n\""He died six months ago,\"" said the rich brother, \""and he left you, as your portion, the old wooden chest that stands in the loft. You had better go there and look for it; I have no more time to waste.\"" And he went his way. So the wanderer turned his steps to the loft, which was at the top of the storehouse, and there he found the wooden chest, so old that it looked as if it were dropping to pieces. \""What use is this old thing to me?\"" he said to himself. \""Oh, well, it will serve to light a fire at which I can warm myself; so things might be worse after all.\""\n\nPlacing the chest on his back, the man, whose name was Jose, set out for his inn and, borrowing a hatchet, began to chop up the box. In doing so, he discovered a secret drawer, and in it lay a paper. He opened the paper, not knowing what it might contain, and was astonished to find that it was the acknowledgment of a large debt that was owing to his father. Putting the precious writing in his pocket, he hastily inquired of the landlord where he could find the man whose name was written inside, and he ran out at once in search of him.\n\nThe debtor proved to be an old miser who lived at the other end of the village. He had hoped for many months that the paper he had written had been lost or destroyed, and indeed, when he saw it, was very unwilling to pay what he owed. However, the stranger threatened to drag him before the king, and when the miser saw that there was no help for it, he counted out the coins one by one. The stranger picked them up and put them in his pocket, and went back to his inn feeling that he was now a rich man.\n\nA few weeks after this, he was walking through the streets of the nearest town when he met a poor woman crying bitterly. He stopped and asked her what was the matter, and she answered between her sobs that her husband was dying, and, to make matters worse, a creditor whom he could not pay was anxious to have him taken to prison. \""Comfort yourself,\"" said the stranger kindly; \""they shall neither send your husband to prison nor sell your goods. I will not only pay his debts but, if he dies, the cost of his burial also. And now go home, and nurse him as well as you can.\""\n\nAnd so she did; but, in spite of her care, the husband died and was buried by the stranger. However, everything cost more than he expected, and when all was paid, he found that only three gold pieces were left. \""What am I to do now?\"" said he to himself. \""I think I had better go to court and enter into the service of the king.\"" At first, he was only a servant who carried the king the water for his bath and saw that his bed was made in a particular fashion. But he did his duties so well that his master soon took notice of him, and in a short time, he rose to be a gentleman of the bedchamber.\n\nNow, when this happened, the younger brother had spent all the money he had inherited and did not know how to make any for himself. He then bethought him of the king's favorite and went whining to the palace to beg that his brother, whom he had so ill-used, would give him his protection and find him a place. The elder, who was always ready to help everyone, spoke to the king on his behalf, and the next day, the young man took up his work at court.\n\nUnfortunately, the newcomer was by nature spiteful and envious and could not bear anyone to have better luck than himself. By dint of spying through keyholes and listening at doors, he learned that the king, old and ugly though he was, had fallen in love with the Princess Bella-Flor, who would have nothing to say to him and had hidden herself in some mountain castle, no one knew where. \""That will do nicely,\"" thought the scoundrel, rubbing his hands. \""It will be quite easy to get the king to send my brother in search of her, and if he returns without finding her, his head will be the forfeit. Either way, he will be out of MY path.\""\n\nSo he went at once to the Lord High Chamberlain and craved an audience of the king, to whom he declared he wished to tell some news of the highest importance. The king admitted him into the presence chamber without delay and bade him state what he had to say, and to be quick about it. \""Oh, sire! the Princess Bella-Flor-\"" answered the man, and then stopped as if afraid. \""What of the Princess Bella-Flor?\"" asked the king impatiently. \""I have heard\u2014it is whispered at court\u2014that your majesty desires to know where she lies in hiding.\"" \n\n\""I would give half my kingdom to the man who will bring her to me,\"" cried the king eagerly. \""Speak on, knave; has a bird of the air revealed to you the secret?\"" \""It is not I, but my brother, who knows,\"" replied the traitor; \""if your majesty would ask him\u2014\"" But before the words were out of his mouth, the king had struck a blow with his sceptre on a golden plate that hung on the wall. \""Order Jose to appear before me instantly,\"" he shouted to the servant who ran to obey his orders, so great was the noise his majesty had made; and when Jose entered the hall, wondering what in the world could be the matter, the king was nearly dumb from rage and excitement.\n\n\""Bring me the Princess Bella-Flor this moment,\"" stammered he, \""for if you return without her, I will have you drowned!\"" And without another word, he left the hall, leaving Jose staring with surprise and horror. \""How can I find the Princess Bella-Flor when I have never even seen her?\"" thought he. \""But it is no use staying here, for I shall only be put to death.\"" And he walked slowly to the stables to choose himself a horse.\n\nThere were rows upon rows of fine beasts with their names written in gold above their stalls, and Jose was looking uncertainly from one to the other, wondering which he should choose, when an old white horse turned its head and signed to him to approach. \""Take me,\"" it said in a gentle whisper, \""and all will go well.\"" Jose still felt so bewildered with the mission that the king had given him that he forgot to be astonished at hearing a horse talk. Mechanically, he laid his hand on the bridle and led the white horse out of the stable. He was about to mount on his back when the animal spoke again: \""Pick up those three loaves of bread which you see there, and put them in your pocket.\""\n\nJose did as he was told, and being in a great hurry to get away, asked no questions but swung himself into the saddle. They rode far without meeting any adventures, but at length, they came to an ant-hill, and the horse stopped. \""Crumble those three loaves for the ants,\"" he said. But Jose hesitated. \""Why, we may want them ourselves!\"" answered he. \""Never mind that; give them to the ants all the same. Do not lose a chance of helping others.\"" And when the loaves lay in crumbs on the road, the horse galloped on.\n\nBy-and-by, they entered a rocky pass between two mountains, and here they saw an eagle that had been caught in a hunter's net. \""Get down and cut the meshes of the net, and set the poor bird free,\"" said the horse. \""But it will take so long,\"" objected Jose, \""and we may miss the princess.\"" \""Never mind that; do not lose a chance of helping others,\"" answered the horse. And when the meshes were cut, and the eagle was free, the horse galloped on.\n\nThey had ridden many miles, and at last, they came to a river, where they beheld a little fish lying gasping on the sand, and the horse said: \""Do you see that little fish? It will die if you do not put it back in the water.\"" \""But, really, we shall never find the Princess Bella-Flor if we waste our time like this!\"" cried Jose. \""We never waste time when we are helping others,\"" answered the horse. And soon the little fish was swimming happily away.\n\nA little while after, they reached a castle, which was built in the middle of a very thick wood, and right in front was the Princess Bella-Flor feeding her hens. \""Now listen,\"" said the horse. \""I am going to give all sorts of little hops and skips, which will amuse the Princess Bella-Flor. Then she will tell you that she would like to ride a little way, and you must help her to mount. When she is seated, I shall begin to neigh and kick, and you must say that I have never carried a woman before, and that you had better get up behind so as to be able to manage me. Once on my back, we will go like the wind to the king's palace.\""\n\nJose did exactly as the horse told him, and everything fell out as the animal prophesied; so that it was not until they were galloping breathlessly towards the palace that the princess knew that she was taken captive. She said nothing, however, but quietly opened her apron, which contained the bran for the chickens, and in a moment, it lay scattered on the ground. \""Oh, I have let fall my bran!\"" cried she; \""please get down and pick it up for me.\"" But Jose only answered: \""We shall find plenty of bran where we are going.\"" And the horse galloped on.\n\nThey were now passing through a forest, and the princess took out her handkerchief and threw it upwards, so that it stuck in one of the topmost branches of a tree. \""Dear me; how stupid! I have let my handkerchief blow away,\"" said she. \""Will you climb up and get it for me?\"" But Jose answered: \""We shall find plenty of handkerchiefs where we are going.\"" And the horse galloped on.\n\nAfter the wood, they reached a river, and the princess slipped a ring off her finger and let it roll into the water. \""How careless of me,\"" gasped she, beginning to sob. \""I have lost my favorite ring; DO stop for a moment and look if you can see it.\"" But Jose answered: \""You will find plenty of rings where you are going.\"" And the horse galloped on.\n\nAt last, they entered the palace gates, and the king's heart bounded with joy at beholding his beloved Princess Bella-Flor. But the princess brushed him aside as if he had been a fly and locked herself into the nearest room, which she would not open for all his entreaties. \""Bring me the three things I lost on the way, and perhaps I may think about it,\"" was all she would say. And in despair, the king was driven to take counsel of Jose. \""There is no remedy that I can see,\"" said his majesty, \""but that you, who know where they are, should go and bring them back. And if you return without them, I will have you drowned.\""\n\nPoor Jose was much troubled at these words. He thought that he had done all that was required of him and that his life was safe. However, he bowed low and went out to consult his friend the horse. \""Do not vex yourself,\"" said the horse when he had heard the story; \""jump up, and we will go and look for the things.\"" And Jose mounted at once.\n\nThey rode on till they came to the ant-hill, and then the horse asked: \""Would you like to have the bran?\"" \""What is the use of liking?\"" answered Jose. \""Well, call the ants, and tell them to fetch it for you; and, if some of it has been scattered by the wind, to bring in its stead the grains that were in the cakes you gave them.\"" Jose listened in surprise. He did not much believe in the horse's plan, but he could not think of anything better, so he called to the ants and bade them collect the bran as fast as they could.\n\nThen he sat under a tree and waited while his horse cropped the green turf. \""Look there!\"" said the animal, suddenly raising its head; and Jose looked behind him and saw a little mountain of bran, which he put into a bag that was hung over his saddle. \""Good deeds bear fruit sooner or later,\"" observed the horse; \""but mount again, as we have far to go.\""\n\nWhen they arrived at the tree, they saw the handkerchief fluttering like a flag from the topmost branch, and Jose's spirits sank again. \""How am I to get that handkerchief?\"" cried he; \""why I should need Jacob's ladder!\"" But the horse answered: \""Do not be frightened; call to the eagle you set free from the net; he will bring it to you.\"" So Jose called to the eagle, and the eagle flew to the top of the tree and brought back the handkerchief in its beak. Jose thanked him, and vaulting on his horse, they rode on to the river.\n\nA great deal of rain had fallen in the night, and the river, instead of being clear as it was before, was dark and troubled. \""How am I to fetch the ring from the bottom of this river when I do not know exactly where it was dropped, and cannot even see it?\"" asked Jose. But the horse answered: \""Do not be frightened; call the little fish whose life you saved, and she will bring it to you.\"" So he called to the fish, and the fish dived to the bottom and slipped behind big stones and moved little ones with its tail till it found the ring and brought it to Jose in its mouth.\n\nWell pleased with all he had done, Jose returned to the palace; but when the king took the precious objects to Bella-Flor, she declared that she would never open her door till the bandit who had carried her off had been fried in oil. \""I am very sorry,\"" said the king to Jose, \""I really would rather not; but you see I have no choice.\"" While the oil was being heated in the great caldron, Jose went to the stables to inquire of his friend the horse if there was no way for him to escape. \""Do not be frightened,\"" said the horse. \""Get on my back, and I will gallop till my whole body is wet with perspiration; then rub it all over your skin, and no matter how hot the oil may be, you will never feel it.\""\n\nJose did not ask any more questions but did as the horse bade him; and men wondered at his cheerful face as they lowered him into the caldron of boiling oil. He was left there till Bella-Flor cried that he must be cooked enough. Then out came a youth so young and handsome that everyone fell in love with him, and Bella-Flor most of all. As for the old king, he saw that he had lost the game; and in despair, he flung himself into the caldron and was fried instead of Jose. \n\nThen Jose was proclaimed king, on condition that he married Bella-Flor, which he promised to do the next day. But first, he went to the stables and sought out the horse, and said to him: \""It is to you that I owe my life and my crown. Why have you done all this for me?\"" And the horse answered: \""I am the soul of that unhappy man for whom you spent all your fortune. And when I saw you in danger of death, I begged that I might help you, as you had helped me. For, as I told you, Good deeds bear their own fruit!\"""""
69,The Flying Trunk,"""There was once a merchant who was so rich that he could have paved the whole street, and perhaps even a little side-street besides, with silver. But he did not do that; he knew another way of spending his money. If he spent a shilling, he got back a florin\u2014such an excellent merchant he was until he died.\n\nNow his son inherited all this money. He lived very merrily; he went every night to the theatre, made paper kites out of five-pound notes, and played ducks and drakes with sovereigns instead of stones. In this way, the money was likely to come soon to an end, and so it did. At last, he had nothing left but four shillings, and he had no clothes except a pair of slippers and an old dressing-gown. His friends did not trouble themselves any more about him; they would not even walk down the street with him.\n\nBut one of them, who was rather good-natured, sent him an old trunk with the message, \""Pack up!\"" That was all very well, but he had nothing to pack up, so he got into the trunk himself. It was an enchanted trunk, for as soon as the lock was pressed, it could fly. He pressed it, and away he flew in it up the chimney, high into the clouds, further and further away. But whenever the bottom gave a little creak, he was in terror lest the trunk should go to pieces, for then he would have turned a dreadful somersault\u2014just think of it!\n\nIn this way, he arrived at the land of the Turks. He hid the trunk in a wood under some dry leaves and then walked into the town. He could do that quite well, for all the Turks were dressed just as he was\u2014in a dressing-gown and slippers. He met a nurse with a little child. \n\n\""Halloa! you Turkish nurse,\"" said he, \""what is that great castle there close to the town? The one with the windows so high up?\"" \n\n\""The sultan's daughter lives there,\"" she replied. \""It is prophesied that she will be very unlucky in her husband, and so no one is allowed to see her except when the sultan and sultana are by.\"" \n\n\""Thank you,\"" said the merchant's son, and he went into the wood, sat himself in his trunk, flew on to the roof, and crept through the window into the princess's room. She was lying on the sofa asleep and was so beautiful that the young merchant had to kiss her. Then she woke up and was very much frightened, but he said he was a Turkish god who had come through the air to see her, and that pleased her very much.\n\nThey sat close to each other, and he told her a story about her eyes. They were beautiful dark lakes in which her thoughts swam about like mermaids. And her forehead was a snowy mountain, grand and shining. These were lovely stories. Then he asked the princess to marry him, and she said yes at once. \n\n\""But you must come here on Saturday,\"" she said, \""for then the sultan and the sultana are coming to tea with me. They will be indeed proud that I receive the god of the Turks. But mind you have a really good story ready, for my parents like them immensely. My mother likes something rather moral and high-flown, and my father likes something merry to make him laugh.\"" \n\n\""Yes, I shall only bring a fairy story for my dowry,\"" said he, and so they parted. But the princess gave him a sabre set with gold pieces which he could use. Then he flew away, bought himself a new dressing-gown, and sat down in the wood and began to make up a story, for it had to be ready by Saturday, and that was no easy matter.\n\nWhen he had it ready, it was Saturday. The sultan, the sultana, and the whole court were at tea with the princess. He was most graciously received. \n\n\""Will you tell us a story?\"" said the sultana; \""one that is thoughtful and instructive?\"" \n\n\""But something that we can laugh at,\"" said the sultan. \n\n\""Oh, certainly,\"" he replied, and began: \""Now, listen attentively. There was once a box of matches which lay between a tinder-box and an old iron pot, and they told the story of their youth.\"" \n\n\""We used to be on the green fir-boughs. Every morning and evening we had diamond-tea, which was the dew, and the whole day long we had sunshine, and the little birds used to tell us stories. We were very rich because the other trees only dressed in summer, but we had green dresses in summer and in winter. Then the woodcutter came, and our family was split up. We have now the task of making light for the lowest people. That is why we grand people are in the kitchen.\"" \n\n\""My fate was quite different,\"" said the iron pot, near which the matches lay. \""Since I came into the world, I have been many times scoured and have cooked much. My only pleasure is to have a good chat with my companions when I am lying nice and clean in my place after dinner.\"" \n\n\""Now you are talking too fast,\"" spluttered the fire. \n\n\""Yes, let us decide who is the grandest!\"" said the matches. \n\n\""No, I don't like talking about myself,\"" said the pot. \n\n\""Let us arrange an evening's entertainment. I will tell the story of my life.\"" \n\n\""On the Baltic by the Danish shore\u2014\"" \n\n\""What a beautiful beginning!\"" said all the plates. \""That's a story that will please us all.\"" \n\nAnd the end was just as good as the beginning. All the plates clattered for joy. \n\n\""Now I will dance,\"" said the tongs, and she danced. Oh! how high she could kick! The old chair-cover in the corner split when he saw her. The urn would have sung, but she said she had a cold; she could not sing unless she boiled. \n\nIn the window was an old quill pen. There was nothing remarkable about her except that she had been dipped too deeply into the ink. But she was very proud of that. \n\n\""If the urn will not sing,\"" said she, \""outside the door hangs a nightingale in a cage who will sing.\"" \n\n\""I don't think it's proper,\"" said the kettle, \""that such a foreign bird should be heard.\"" \n\n\""Oh, let us have some acting,\"" said everyone. \""Do let us!\"" \n\nSuddenly the door opened, and the maid came in. Everyone was quite quiet. There was not a sound. But each pot knew what he might have done, and how grand he was. \n\nThe maid took the matches and lit the fire with them. How they spluttered and flamed, to be sure! \""Now everyone can see,\"" they thought, \""that we are the grandest! How we sparkle! What a light\u2014\"" \n\nBut here they were burnt out. \n\n\""That was a delightful story!\"" said the sultana. \""I quite feel myself in the kitchen with the matches. Yes, now you shall marry our daughter.\"" \n\n\""Yes, indeed,\"" said the sultan, \""you shall marry our daughter on Monday.\"" And they treated the young man as one of the family. \n\nThe wedding was arranged, and the night before, the whole town was illuminated. Biscuits and gingerbreads were thrown among the people, the street boys stood on tiptoe crying hurrahs and whistling through their fingers. It was all splendid. \n\n\""Now I must also give them a treat,\"" thought the merchant's son. And so he bought rockets, crackers, and all the kinds of fireworks you can think of, put them in his trunk, and flew up with them into the air. \n\nWhirr-r-r, how they fizzed and blazed! All the Turks jumped so high that their slippers flew above their heads; such a splendid glitter they had never seen before. Now they could quite well understand that it was the god of the Turks himself who was to marry the princess.\n\nAs soon as the young merchant came down again into the wood with his trunk, he thought, \""Now I will just go into the town to see how the show has taken.\"" And it was quite natural that he should want to do this. \n\nOh! what stories the people had to tell! Each one whom he asked had seen it differently, but they had all found it beautiful. \n\n\""I saw the Turkish god himself,\"" said one. \""He had eyes like glittering stars, and a beard like foaming water.\"" \n\n\""He flew away in a cloak of fire,\"" said another. They were splendid things that he heard, and the next day was to be his wedding day. \n\nThen he went back into the wood to sit in his trunk; but what had become of it? The trunk had been burnt. A spark of the fireworks had set it alight, and the trunk was in ashes. He could no longer fly and could never reach his bride. \n\nShe stood the whole day long on the roof and waited; perhaps she is waiting there still. But he wandered through the world and told stories, though they are not so merry as the one he told about the matches."""
1,Grandmother,"""Grandmother is very old, her face is wrinkled, and her hair is quite white; but her eyes are like two stars, and they have a mild, gentle expression in them when they look at you, which does you good. She wears a dress of heavy, rich silk, with large flowers worked on it, and it rustles when she moves. And then she can tell the most wonderful stories. Grandmother knows a great deal, for she was alive before father and mother\u2014that's quite certain. She has a hymn-book with large silver clasps, in which she often reads; and in the book, between the leaves, lies a rose, quite flat and dry. It is not so pretty as the roses which are standing in the glass, and yet she smiles at it most pleasantly, and tears even come into her eyes.\n\n\""I wonder why grandmother looks at the withered flower in the old book that way? Do you know?\"" When grandmother's tears fall upon the rose, and she is looking at it, the rose revives and fills the room with its fragrance. The walls vanish as in a mist, and all around her is the glorious green wood, where in summer the sunlight streams through thick foliage. Grandmother, why she is young again, a charming maiden, fresh as a rose, with round, rosy cheeks, fair, bright ringlets, and a figure pretty and graceful; but the eyes, those mild, saintly eyes, are the same\u2014they have been left to grandmother. At her side sits a young man, tall and strong; he gives her a rose, and she smiles. Grandmother cannot smile like that now. Yes, she is smiling at the memory of that day, and many thoughts and recollections of the past; but the handsome young man is gone, and the rose has withered in the old book, and grandmother is sitting there, again an old woman, looking down upon the withered rose in the book.\n\nGrandmother is dead now. She had been sitting in her arm-chair, telling us a long, beautiful tale; and when it was finished, she said she was tired and leaned her head back to sleep awhile. We could hear her gentle breathing as she slept; gradually it became quieter and calmer, and on her countenance beamed happiness and peace. It was as if lighted up with a ray of sunshine. She smiled once more, and then people said she was dead. She was laid in a black coffin, looking mild and beautiful in the white folds of the shrouded linen, though her eyes were closed; but every wrinkle had vanished, her hair looked white and silvery, and around her mouth lingered a sweet smile. We did not feel at all afraid to look at the corpse of her who had been such a dear, good grandmother. The hymn-book, in which the rose still lay, was placed under her head, for so she had wished it; and then they buried grandmother.\n\nOn the grave, close by the churchyard wall, they planted a rose-tree; it was soon full of roses, and the nightingale sat among the flowers and sang over the grave. From the organ in the church sounded the music and the words of the beautiful psalms, which were written in the old book under the head of the dead one. The moon shone down upon the grave, but the dead was not there; every child could go safely, even at night, and pluck a rose from the tree by the churchyard wall. The dead know more than we do who are living. They know what a terror would come upon us if such a strange thing were to happen, as the appearance of a dead person among us. They are better off than we are; the dead return no more. The earth has been heaped on the coffin, and it is earth only that lies within it. The leaves of the hymn-book are dust; and the rose, with all its recollections, has crumbled to dust also. But over the grave, fresh roses bloom, the nightingale sings, and the organ sounds, and there still lives a remembrance of old grandmother, with the loving, gentle eyes that always looked young. Eyes can never die. Ours will once again behold dear grandmother, young and beautiful as when, for the first time, she kissed the fresh, red rose, that is now dust in the grave."""
2,Naughty Boy,"""A long time ago, there lived an old poet, a thoroughly kind old poet. One evening, as he sat in his room, a dreadful storm arose outside, and the rain streamed down from heaven. Despite the tempest, the old poet remained warm and comfortable in his chimney-corner, where the fire blazed and the roasting apple hissed. \""Those who have not a roof over their heads will be wetted to the skin,\"" he remarked, feeling sympathy for those caught in the storm.\n\nSuddenly, a child\u2019s voice broke through the howling wind. \""Oh let me in! Let me in! I am cold, and I'm so wet!\"" cried a little boy, who stood at the door, knocking for admittance. The rain poured down, and the wind rattled the windows. \""Poor thing!\"" said the old poet, rushing to open the door. There stood a little boy, completely naked, with water streaming down from his long golden hair. He trembled with cold, and had he not found refuge in the warm room, he would most certainly have perished in the frightful tempest.\n\n\""Poor child!\"" said the old poet, taking the boy by the hand. \""Come in, come in, and I will soon restore thee! Thou shalt have wine and roasted apples, for thou art verily a charming child!\"" The boy truly was charming; his eyes sparkled like two bright stars, and although water trickled down his hair, it waved in beautiful curls. He looked exactly like a little angel, but he was so pale, and his whole body shook with cold. He held a nice little bow in his hand, but it was quite spoiled by the rain, and the colors of his many-colored arrows had run together.\n\nThe old poet seated himself beside the hearth and took the little fellow on his lap. He squeezed the water out of the boy's dripping hair, warmed his hands between his own, and boiled some sweet wine for him. Gradually, the boy recovered; his cheeks grew rosy, and he jumped down from the poet's lap, dancing around the kind old man. \""You are a merry fellow,\"" said the old poet. \""What's your name?\"" \""My name is Cupid,\"" answered the boy. \""Don't you know me? There lies my bow. It shoots well, I can assure you! Look, the weather is now clearing up, and the moon is shining clear again through the window.\""\n\n\""Why, your bow is quite spoiled,\"" said the old poet. \""That would be sad indeed,\"" replied the boy, examining the bow closely. \""Oh, it is dry again and is not hurt at all. The string is quite tight. I will try it directly.\"" With that, he bent his bow, took aim, and shot an arrow at the old poet, right into his heart. \""You see now that my bow was not spoiled,\"" he laughed, and away he ran. The naughty boy had shot the old poet in such a way! The poet, who had taken him into his warm room and treated him so kindly, now lay on the ground weeping, for the arrow had truly pierced his heart. \""Fie!\"" he lamented. \""How naughty a boy Cupid is! I will tell all children about him, that they may take care and not play with him, for he will only cause them sorrow and many a heartache.\""\n\nAs the old poet shared his story with good children, they took heed of the naughty Cupid. However, he was astonishingly cunning. When university students left their lectures, he would run beside them in a black coat, with a book under his arm. It was impossible for them to recognize him, and they would walk along with him, arm in arm, as if he were a fellow student. Unbeknownst to them, he would then thrust an arrow into their bosoms. Similarly, when young maidens came from being examined by the clergyman or went to church for confirmation, Cupid was always close behind them. He was forever following people.\n\nAt the theater, he sat in the grand chandelier, burning in bright flames, leading people to believe it was merely a flame, until they soon discovered otherwise. He roamed about in the gardens of palaces and upon the ramparts; indeed, he once even shot the poet's own father and mother right in the heart. If you ask them, they will tell you all about it.\n\nOh, he is a naughty boy, that Cupid; you must never have anything to do with him. He is forever running after everybody. Just think, he shot an arrow once at your old grandmother! But that was a long time ago, and it is all past now; however, it is a memory she never forgets. Fie, naughty Cupid! But now you know him, and you also know how ill-behaved he is!"""
3,Red Shoes,"""Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Karen, who was pretty and dainty. However, due to her family's poverty, she was obliged to go barefoot in the summer and wear large wooden shoes in the winter, which left her little instep quite red. In the middle of the village lived an old shoemaker's wife who, with good intentions, made a pair of little shoes out of some old pieces of red cloth for Karen. Although the shoes were clumsy, they were a kind gesture meant to bring comfort to the little girl.\n\nKaren wore the shoes for the first time on the day of her mother's funeral. They were certainly not suitable for mourning, but she had no other shoes, so she put her bare feet into them and walked behind the humble coffin. At that moment, a large old carriage passed by, and an old lady inside took pity on Karen. She asked the clergyman if she could take care of the little girl. Karen believed this was due to the red shoes, but the old lady thought them hideous, and they were soon burnt. Despite this, Karen was dressed neatly and taught to read and sew, and people began to say she was beautiful, a sentiment echoed by the mirror.\n\nOne day, the Queen traveled through the area with her little daughter, a princess. The townspeople, including Karen, flocked to the castle to see the princess, who wore beautiful red morocco shoes that were much finer than the ones made for Karen. The allure of red shoes captivated Karen, and when she was old enough to be confirmed, she received new clothes and was to have new shoes. The rich shoemaker took her measurements and among the lovely shoes, there was a pair of red ones that had been made for a count's daughter but did not fit her. Karen tried them on, and they fit perfectly. Unbeknownst to the old lady, who would never have allowed Karen to wear red shoes for her confirmation, the shoes were bought.\n\nAs Karen walked to church, she felt the eyes of everyone on her red shoes, even the ancient figures on the monuments seemed to gaze at them. During the confirmation ceremony, while the clergyman spoke of holy baptism, Karen could think only of her red shoes. After the service, the old lady learned that Karen had worn red shoes and deemed it shocking and improper, insisting that Karen should wear black shoes to church from then on.\n\nThe following Sunday, during Communion, Karen found herself torn between the black shoes and the red ones. Ultimately, she chose the red shoes. The sun shone brightly as she and the old lady walked to church, but at the church door, an old soldier asked if he could wipe their shoes. When he saw Karen's red shoes, he exclaimed how pretty they were, and Karen, unable to resist, danced a few steps. Once she started, she could not stop, and the shoes seemed to have a power over her. The coachman had to chase after her to lift her into the carriage, but even then, her feet continued to dance, kicking the old lady.\n\nAt home, the red shoes were put away, but Karen could not help but look at them. Soon, the old lady fell ill, and while she nursed her, Karen was invited to a grand ball. Tempted by the red shoes, she put them on and went to the ball, but once again, the shoes took control, leading her away from the festivities and into the dark woods. There, she encountered the old soldier again, who remarked on her pretty dancing shoes. Frightened, Karen tried to remove the shoes, but they were stuck fast. She danced endlessly, unable to stop, through rain and sunshine, day and night, until she found herself in a churchyard where the dead did not dance.\n\nIn her despair, she saw an angel with a stern face holding a shining sword, who condemned her to dance until she was pale and cold. Karen cried for mercy, but the shoes carried her away, forcing her to dance through the night. One morning, she passed a familiar door where a coffin was being carried out, realizing she was forsaken and damned. She danced on, torn and bleeding, until she reached the executioner's house. Desperate, she begged him not to cut off her head but to sever her feet from the red shoes. After confessing her sins, the executioner complied, but the shoes danced away with her little feet.\n\nHe fashioned her wooden feet and crutches, teaching her a psalm for sinners. Grateful, she left and resolved to go to church, believing she had suffered enough. However, when she reached the church door, the red shoes danced before her, causing her to turn back in fear. For a week, she mourned, but when Sunday came again, she felt she was as good as anyone else in church. Yet, as she approached the churchyard gate, the red shoes danced before her once more, and she repented of her sin.\n\nSeeking redemption, she went to the parsonage and asked to be taken into service. The pastor's wife took pity on her, and Karen worked diligently, listening to the pastor read from the Bible. Although the children liked her, she shook her head at discussions of dress and beauty. On the next Sunday, when invited to church, she looked sadly at her crutches and chose to stay in her room, reading her hymn-book. As she prayed for help, an angel appeared, no longer holding a sword but a green branch full of roses, which he used to touch the ceiling, revealing a golden star.\n\nThe walls of her small room opened, and she found herself in the church, sitting with the pastor's household. They welcomed her, affirming her decision to come. The organ played, and the children's choir sang sweetly. As the sunlight streamed through the window, Karen's heart filled with peace and joy, and in that moment, it broke. Her soul soared on the sunbeams to Heaven, free from the burden of the red shoes, and no one asked after them again."""
4,Storks,"""On the last house in the village, there lay a stork's nest. The mother stork sat in it with her four little ones, who were stretching out their heads with their pointed black bills that had not yet turned red. At a little distance, on the top of the roof, stood the father stork, bolt upright and as stiff as could be. To avoid appearing idle while standing sentry, he had drawn one leg up under him, as is the manner of storks. One might have taken him to be carved in marble, so still did he stand.\n\n\""It must look very grand for my wife to have a sentinel to guard her nest,\"" he thought. \""They can't know that I am her husband and will, of course, conclude that I am commanded to stand here by her nest. It looks aristocratic!\"" Below, in the street, a crowd of children were playing. When they chanced to catch sight of the storks, one of the boldest of the boys began to sing the old song about the stork. The others soon joined him, but each sang the words that he happened to have heard. \n\n\""Stork, stork, fly away; Stand not on one leg to-day. Thy dear wife sits in the nest, To lull the little ones to rest. There's a halter for one, There's a stake for another, For the third there's a gun, And a spit for his brother!\"" \n\n\""Only listen,\"" said the young storks, \""to what the boys are singing. Do you hear them say we're to be hanged and shot?\"" \""Don't listen to what they say; if you don't mind, it won't hurt you,\"" said the mother. But the boys went on singing and pointed mockingly at the sentinel stork. Only one boy, whom they called Peter, said it was a shame to make game of animals, and he would not join in the singing at all. The mother stork tried to comfort her young ones. \""Don't mind them,\"" she said; \""see how quiet your father stands on one leg there.\"" \n\n\""But we are afraid,\"" said the little ones, drawing back their beaks into the nest. The children assembled again the next day, and no sooner did they see the storks than they began their song once more: \""The first will be hanged, The second be hit.\"" \""Tell us, are we to be hanged and burned?\"" asked the young storks. \""No, no; certainly not,\"" replied the mother. \""You are to learn to fly, and then we shall pay a visit to the frogs. They will bow to us in the water and sing 'Croak! croak!' and we shall eat them up, and that will be a great treat.\"" \n\n\""And then what?\"" questioned the young storks. \""Oh, then all the storks in the land will assemble, and the autumn sports will begin; only then one must be able to fly well, for that is very important. Whoever does not fly as he should will be pierced to death by the general's beak, so mind that you learn well when the drill begins.\"" \""Yes, but then, after that, we shall be killed, as the boys say. Hark! they are singing it again.\"" \""Attend to me and not to them,\"" said the mother stork. \""After the great review, we shall fly away to warm countries, far from here, over hills and forests. To Egypt we shall fly, where are the three-cornered houses of stone, one point of which reaches to the clouds; they are called pyramids and are older than a stork can imagine. In that same land, there is a river which overflows its banks and turns the whole country into mire. We shall go into the mire and eat frogs.\"" \n\n\""Oh! oh!\"" exclaimed all the youngsters. \""Yes, it is indeed a delightful place. We need do nothing all day long but eat; and while we are feasting there so comfortably, in this country, there is not a green leaf left on the trees. It is so cold here that the very clouds freeze in lumps or fall down in little white rags.\"" It was hail and snow that she meant, but she did not know how to say it better. \""And will the naughty boys freeze in lumps?\"" asked the young storks. \""No, they will not freeze in lumps, but they will come near it, and they will sit moping and cowering in gloomy rooms while you are flying about in foreign lands, amid bright flowers and warm sunshine.\""\n\nSome time passed, and the nestlings had grown so large and strong that they could stand upright in the nest and look all about them. Every day the father stork came with delicious frogs, nice little snakes, and other such dainties that storks delight in. How funny it was to see the clever feats he performed to amuse them! He would lay his head right round upon his tail; and sometimes he would clatter with his beak, as if it were a little rattle; or he would tell them stories, all relating to swamps and fens. \n\n\""Come, children,\"" said the mother stork one day, \""now you must learn to fly.\"" All four young storks had to go out on the ridge of the roof. How they did totter and stagger about! They tried to balance themselves with their wings but came very near falling to the ground. \""Look at me!\"" said the mother. \""This is the way to hold your head. And thus you must place your feet. Left! right! left! right! that's what will help you on in the world.\"" Then she flew a little way, and the young ones took a clumsy little leap. Bump! plump! down they fell, for their bodies were still too heavy for them. \n\n\""I will not fly,\"" said one of the young storks, as he crept back to the nest. \""I don't care about going to warm countries.\"" \""Do you want to stay here and freeze when the winter comes? Will you wait till the boys come to hang, to burn, or to roast you? Well, then, I'll call them.\"" \""Oh, no!\"" cried the timid stork, hopping back to the roof with the rest. By the third day, they actually began to fly a little. Then they had no doubt that they could soar or hover in the air, upborne by their wings. And this they attempted to do, but down they fell, flapping their wings as fast as they could.\n\nAgain the boys came to the street, singing their song, \""Storks, storks, fly home and rest.\"" \""Shall we fly down and peck them?\"" asked the young ones. \""No, leave them alone. Attend to me; that's far more important. One--two--three! now we fly round to the right. One--two--three! now to the left, round the chimney. There! that was very good. That last flap with your wings and the kick with your feet were so graceful and proper that tomorrow you shall fly with me to the marsh. Several of the nicest stork families will be there with their children. Let me see that mine are the best bred of all. Carry your heads high and mind you strut about proudly, for that looks well and helps to make one respected.\""\n\n\""But shall we not take revenge upon the naughty boys?\"" asked the young storks. \""No, no; let them scream away, as much as they please. You are to fly up to the clouds and away to the land of the pyramids, while they are freezing and can neither see a green leaf nor taste a sweet apple.\"" \""But we will revenge ourselves,\"" they whispered one to another. And then the training began again.\n\nAmong all the children down in the street, the one that seemed most bent upon singing the song that made game of the storks was the boy who had begun it, and he was a little fellow hardly more than six years old. The young storks, to be sure, thought he was at least a hundred, for he was much bigger than their parents, and, besides, what did they know about the ages of either children or grown men? Their whole vengeance was to be aimed at this one boy. It was always he who began the song and persisted in mocking them. The young storks were very angry, and as they grew larger, they also grew less patient under insult, and their mother was at last obliged to promise them that they might be revenged\u2014but not until the day of their departure.\n\n\""We must first see how you carry yourselves at the great review. If you do so badly that the general runs his beak through you, then the boys will be in the right\u2014at least in one way. We must wait and see!\"" \""Yes, you shall see!\"" cried all the young storks; and they took the greatest pains, practicing every day, until they flew so evenly and so lightly that it was a pleasure to see them. The autumn now set in; all the storks began to assemble, in order to start for the warm countries and leave winter behind them. And such exercises as there were! Young fledglings were set to fly over forests and villages, to see if they were equal to the long journey that was before them. \n\nSo well did our young storks acquit themselves that, as a proof of the satisfaction they had given, the mark they got was, \""Remarkably well,\"" with a present of a frog and a snake, which they lost no time in eating. \""Now,\"" said they, \""we will be revenged.\"" \""Yes, certainly,\"" said their mother; \""and I have thought of a way that will surely be the fairest. I know a pond where all the little human children lie till the stork comes to take them to their parents. There lie the pretty little babies, dreaming more sweetly than they ever dream afterwards. All the parents are wishing for one of these little ones, and the children all want a sister or a brother. Now we'll fly to the pond and bring back a baby for every child who did not sing the naughty song that made game of the storks.\""\n\n\""But the very naughty boy who was the first to begin the song,\"" cried the young storks, \""what shall we do with him?\"" \""There is a little dead child in the pond\u2014one that has dreamed itself to death. We will bring that for him. Then he will cry because we have brought a little dead brother to him. But that good boy\u2014you have not forgotten him!\u2014the one who said it was a shame to mock at the animals; for him we will bring both a brother and a sister. And because his name is Peter, all of you shall be called Peter, too.\"" \n\nAll was done as the mother had said; the storks were named Peter, and so they are called to this day."""
5,The Mother,"""A mother sat there with her little child, her heart heavy with sorrow and fear that it might die. The child was so pale, its small eyes closed, and it breathed softly, occasionally sighing deeply. The mother gazed sorrowfully at her little one, feeling the weight of despair pressing down on her.\n\nSuddenly, a knocking was heard at the door, and in came a poor old man wrapped in a large horse-cloth for warmth. It was a cold winter season, with everything outside covered in ice and snow, and the wind biting at the skin. As the old man trembled with cold, the mother poured some ale into a pot and set it on the stove to warm for him. The old man sat rocking the cradle while the mother sat nearby, her eyes fixed on her sick child, who drew its breath so deeply and raised its little hand.\n\n\""Do you not think that I shall save him?\"" she asked, her voice trembling. \""Our Lord will not take him from me!\"" The old man, who was in fact Death himself, nodded in a way that could mean either yes or no. The mother, feeling hopeless, looked down into her lap, tears streaming down her cheeks. Exhausted from sleepless nights, she finally succumbed to fatigue and fell asleep for just a moment. When she awoke, she found the old man and her child were gone. The old clock in the corner ticked ominously, and then it too fell silent.\n\nDesperate, the mother ran out of the house, crying out for her child. In the midst of the snow, she encountered a woman dressed in long black clothes. The woman informed her, \""Death has been in thy chamber, and I saw him hasten away with thy little child. He goes faster than the wind and never brings back what he takes!\"" \n\n\""Please, tell me which way he went!\"" the mother pleaded. \""Tell me the way, and I shall find him!\"" The woman replied, \""I know it! But first, you must sing for me all the songs you have sung for your child. I am fond of them. I have heard them before. I am Night, and I saw your tears while you sang them!\"" \n\n\""I will sing them all!\"" the mother exclaimed. \""But do not stop me now\u2014I may overtake him; I may find my child!\"" Yet Night remained silent. The mother wrung her hands, sang, and wept, pouring out many songs and even more tears. Finally, Night instructed her to go to the right, into the dark pine forest, where she had seen Death take his path with the child.\n\nAs she ventured deeper into the forest, the roads crossed, and she became lost. There, she found a thorn-bush, bare of leaves and flowers, with ice flakes hanging from its branches. \""Hast thou not seen Death pass with my little child?\"" she asked. The thorn-bush replied, \""Yes, but I will not tell you which way he took unless you warm me at your heart. I am freezing to death!\"" \n\nWithout hesitation, the mother pressed the thorn-bush to her breast, enduring the pain of its thorns piercing her flesh. Her blood flowed, but the thorn-bush blossomed with fresh green leaves and flowers in the cold winter night, warming her heart. It then revealed the way she should go.\n\nNext, she arrived at a large lake, which was neither frozen nor low enough for her to wade through. Desperate to cross, she lay down to drink up the lake, knowing it was impossible for a human being. \""Oh, what would I not give to come to my child!\"" she cried, and as she wept, her eyes sank into the depths of the water, transforming into two precious pearls. Miraculously, the water buoyed her up, and she floated to the opposite shore.\n\nThere stood a strange house, resembling a mountain with forests and caverns, but the poor mother could not see it clearly; she had wept her eyes out. \""Where shall I find Death, who took away my little child?\"" she asked an old grave woman who tended to Death's great greenhouse. \""He has not come here yet!\"" the woman replied. \""How did you find your way here? Who helped you?\"" \n\n\""OUR LORD has helped me,\"" the mother said. \""He is merciful, and you will be too! Where shall I find my little child?\"" The old woman shook her head, explaining that many flowers and trees had withered that night, and Death would soon come to plant them anew. She advised the mother to seek her child's life tree or flower, as each person had one, pulsating with life. \n\nThe mother agreed to give her long black hair in exchange for the old woman's white hair, and they entered Death's greenhouse, where flowers and trees grew together. Amongst the plants, the mother listened for her child's heartbeat. Finally, she recognized her child's life in a little blue crocus, sickly and drooping.\n\n\""Don't touch the flower!\"" the old woman warned. \""When Death comes, do not let him pluck it up. Threaten him that you will do the same with the others, and he will be afraid!\"" Just then, an icy cold swept through the hall, signaling Death's arrival. \n\n\""How hast thou been able to find thy way hither?\"" he asked, surprised. \""How couldst thou come quicker than I?\"" The mother, determined, held tightly to his hand as he reached for the flower. But Death's coldness made her hands fall powerless. \""Thou canst not do anything against me!\"" he declared. \n\n\""But OUR LORD can!\"" she retorted. Death explained that he was merely a gardener, taking flowers and trees to plant in the great garden of Paradise, but he could not reveal how they grew there. The mother begged him to return her child, weeping and praying. In a moment of desperation, she threatened to tear up two nearby flowers, crying out in despair.\n\n\""Touch them not!\"" Death warned. \""You say you are unhappy, yet you would make another mother equally so.\"" The mother, realizing her mistake, released her hold. Death then revealed that he had fished her eyes from the lake, and she could take them back, now brighter than before. He offered to show her the future lives of the two flowers she nearly destroyed.\n\nPeering into the well, she saw one flower bringing joy and happiness to the world, while the other was destined for sorrow and distress. \""Both of them are God's will!\"" Death stated. The mother, terrified, begged him to tell her which flower was her child, pleading for the innocent to be saved from misery.\n\n\""I do not understand thee!\"" Death replied. \""Wilt thou have thy child again, or shall I go with it there, where thou dost not know?\"" The mother fell to her knees, wringing her hands in prayer to the Lord, \""Oh, hear me not when I pray against Thy will, which is the best! Hear me not! Hear me not!\"" \n\nWith her head bowed in despair, Death took her child and departed into the unknown land, leaving the mother alone in her grief."""
6,The Brownie Of The Lake,"""Once upon a time, there lived in France a man named Jalm Riou. You might have walked a whole day without meeting anyone happier or more contented, for he had a large farm, plenty of money, and above all, a daughter named Barbaik, the most graceful dancer and the best-dressed girl in the whole countryside. When she appeared on holidays in her embroidered cap, five petticoats, each one a little shorter than the other, and shoes with silver buckles, the women were all filled with envy. However, little cared Barbaik what they might whisper behind her back as long as she knew that her clothes were finer than anyone else's and that she had more partners than any other girl.\n\nAmongst all the young men who wanted to marry Barbaik, the one whose heart was most set on her was her father's head man, Jegu. However, as his manners were rough and he was exceedingly ugly, she would have nothing to say to him and often made fun of him with the rest. Jegu, of course, heard of this, and it made him very unhappy. Still, he would not leave the farm to look for work elsewhere, as he might have done, for then he would never see Barbaik at all, and what was life worth to him without that?\n\nOne evening, while bringing back his horses from the fields, Jegu stopped at a little lake on the way home to let them drink. He was tired from a long day's work and stood with his hand on the mane of one of the animals, thinking of Barbaik, when a voice came out of the gorse close by. \""What is the matter, Jegu? You mustn't despair yet.\"" The young man glanced up in surprise and asked who was there. \""It is I, the brownie of the lake,\"" replied the voice. \""Look close, and you will see me among the reeds in the form of a little green frog. I can take,\"" he added proudly, \""any shape I choose, and even, which is much harder, be invisible if I want to.\""\n\n\""Then show yourself to me in the shape in which your family generally appear,\"" replied Jegu. \""Certainly, if you wish,\"" and the frog jumped on the back of one of the horses and changed into a little dwarf, all dressed in green. This transformation rather frightened Jegu, but the brownie bade him have no fears, for he would not do him any harm; indeed, he hoped that Jegu might find him of some use. \""But why should you take all this interest in me?\"" asked the peasant suspiciously. \""Because of a service you did me last winter, which I have never forgotten,\"" answered the little fellow.\n\n\""You know, I am sure, that the korigans who dwell in the White Corn country have declared war on my people because they say that they are the friends of man. We were therefore obliged to take refuge in distant lands and to hide ourselves at first under different animal shapes. Since that time, partly from habit and partly to amuse ourselves, we have continued to transform ourselves, and it was in this way that I got to know you.\"" \""How?\"" exclaimed Jegu, filled with astonishment. \""Do you remember when you were digging in the field near the river three months ago, and you found a robin redbreast caught in a net?\"" \""Yes,\"" answered Jegu, \""I remember it very well, and I opened the net and let him go.\"" \""Well, I was that robin redbreast, and ever since I have vowed to be your friend, and as you want to marry Barbaik, I will prove the truth of what I say by helping you to do so.\""\n\n\""Ah! my little brownie, if you can do that, there is nothing I won't give you, except my soul.\"" \""Then let me alone,\"" rejoined the dwarf, \""and I promise you that in a very few months you shall be master of the farm and of Barbaik.\"" \""But how are you going to do it?\"" exclaimed Jegu wonderingly. \""That is my affair. Perhaps I may tell you later. Meanwhile, you just eat and sleep, and don't worry yourself about anything.\"" Jegu declared that nothing could be easier, and then, taking off his hat, he thanked the dwarf heartily and led his horses back to the farm.\n\nThe next morning was a holiday, and Barbaik was awake earlier than usual, as she wished to get through her work as soon as possible and be ready to start for a dance which was to be held some distance off. She went first to the cow-house, which it was her duty to keep clean, but to her amazement, she found fresh straw put down, the racks filled with hay, the cows milked, and the pails standing neatly in a row. \""Of course, Jegu must have done this in the hope of my giving him a dance,\"" she thought to herself. When she met him outside the door, she stopped and thanked him for his help. To be sure, Jegu only replied roughly that he didn't know what she was talking about, but this answer made her feel all the more certain that it was he and nobody else.\n\nThe same thing took place every day, and never had the cow-house been so clean nor the cows so fat. Morning and evening, Barbaik found her earthen pots full of milk and a pound of butter freshly churned, ornamented with leaves. At the end of a few weeks, she grew so used to this state of affairs that she only got up just in time to prepare breakfast. Soon even this grew to be unnecessary, for a day arrived when, coming downstairs, she discovered that the house was swept, the furniture polished, the fire lit, and the food ready, so that she had nothing to do except to ring the great bell which summoned the laborers from the fields to come and eat it. This, also, she thought was the work of Jegu, and she could not help feeling that a husband of this sort would be very useful to a girl who liked to lie in bed and amuse herself.\n\nIndeed, Barbaik had only to express a wish for it to be satisfied. If the wind was cold or the sun was hot and she was afraid to go out lest her complexion should be spoiled, she need only to run down to the spring close by and say softly, \""I should like my churns to be full, and my wet linen to be stretched on the hedge to dry,\"" and she need never give another thought to the matter. If she found the rye bread too hard to bake, or the oven taking too long to heat, she just murmured, \""I should like to see my six loaves on the shelf above the bread box,\"" and two hours after, there they were. If she was too lazy to walk all the way to market along a dirty road, she would say out loud the night before, \""Why am I not already back from Morlaix with my milk pot empty, my butter bowl inside it, a pound of wild cherries on my wooden plate, and the money I have gained in my apron pocket?\"" and in the morning when she got up, lo and behold! there were standing at the foot of her bed the empty milk pot with the butter bowl inside, the black cherries on the wooden plate, and six new pieces of silver in the pocket of her apron. She believed that all this was owing to Jegu, and she could no longer do without him, even in her thoughts.\n\nWhen things had reached this pass, the brownie told the young man that he had better ask Barbaik to marry him. This time, the girl did not turn rudely away but listened patiently to the end. In her eyes, he was as ugly and awkward as ever, but he would certainly make a most useful husband, and she could sleep every morning till breakfast time, just like a young lady. As for the rest of the day, it would not be half long enough for all she meant to do. She would wear the beautiful dresses that came when she wished for them, visit her neighbors, who would be dying of envy all the while, and she would be able to dance as much as she wished. Jegu would always be there to work for her, save for her, and watch over her. So, like a well-brought-up girl, Barbaik answered that it should be as her father pleased, knowing quite well that old Riou had often said that after he was dead, there was no one so capable of carrying on the farm.\n\nThe marriage took place the following month, and a few days later, the old man died quite suddenly. Now Jegu had everything to see to himself, and somehow it did not seem so easy as when the farmer was alive. But once more, the brownie stepped in and was better than ten laborers. It was he who ploughed, sowed, and reaped, and if, as happened occasionally, it was needful to get the work done quickly, the brownie called in some of his friends. As soon as it was light, a host of little dwarfs might have been seen in the fields, busy with hoe, fork, or sickle. But by the time the people were about, all was finished, and the little fellows had disappeared.\n\nAll the payment the brownie ever asked for was a bowl of broth. From the very day of her marriage, Barbaik noted with surprise and rage that things ceased to be done for her as they had been done all the weeks and months before. She complained to Jegu of his laziness, and he only stared at her, not understanding what she was talking about. But the brownie, who was standing by, burst out laughing and confessed that all the good offices she spoke of had been performed by him for the sake of Jegu, but that now he had other business to do, and it was high time that she looked after her house herself.\n\nBarbaik was furious. Each morning when she was obliged to get up before dawn to milk the cows and go to market, and each evening when she had to sit up till midnight in order to churn the butter, her heart was filled with rage against the brownie who had caused her to expect a life of ease and pleasure. But when she looked at Jegu and beheld his red face, squinting eyes, and untidy hair, her anger was doubled. \""If it had not been for you, you miserable dwarf!\"" she would say between her teeth, \""if it had not been for you, I should never have married that man, and I should still have been going to dances, where the young men would have brought me presents of nuts and cherries, and told me that I was the prettiest girl in the parish. While now I can receive no presents except from my husband. I can never dance, except with my husband. Oh, you wretched dwarf, I will never, never forgive you!\""\n\nIn spite of her fierce words, no one knew better than Barbaik how to put her pride in her pocket when it suited her. After receiving an invitation to a wedding, she begged the brownie to get her a horse to ride there. To her great joy, he consented, bidding her set out for the city of the dwarfs and to tell them exactly what she wanted. Full of excitement, Barbaik started on her journey. It was not long, and when she reached the town, she went straight to the dwarfs, who were holding counsel in a wide green place, and said to them, \""Listen, my friends! I have come to beg you to lend me a black horse, with eyes, a mouth, ears, bridle, and saddle.\""\n\nShe had hardly spoken when the horse appeared, and mounting on his back, she started for the village where the wedding was to be held. At first, she was so delighted with the chance of a holiday from the work which she hated that she noticed nothing. But very soon, it struck her as odd that as she passed along the roads full of people, they all laughed as they looked at her horse. At length, she caught some words uttered by one man to another. \""Why, the farmer's wife has sold her horse's tail!\"" and turned in her saddle. Yes; it was true. Her horse had no tail! She had forgotten to ask for one, and the wicked dwarfs had carried out her orders to the letter!\n\n\""Well, at any rate, I shall soon be there,\"" she thought, and shaking the reins, tried to urge the horse to a gallop. But it was of no use; he declined to move out of a walk, and she was forced to hear all the jokes that were made upon her. In the evening, she returned to the farm more angry than ever and quite determined to revenge herself on the brownie whenever she had the chance, which happened to be very soon.\n\nIt was the spring, and just the time of year when the dwarfs held their f\u00eate, so one day the brownie asked Jegu if he might bring his friends to have supper in the great barn and whether he would allow them to dance there. Of course, Jegu was only too pleased to be able to do anything for the brownie, and he ordered Barbaik to spread her best tablecloths in the barn, make a quantity of little loaves and pancakes, and keep all the milk given by the cows that morning. He expected she would refuse, as he knew she hated the dwarfs, but she said nothing and prepared the supper as he had bidden her.\n\nWhen all was ready, the dwarfs, in new green suits, came bustling in, very happy and merry, and took their seats at the table. But in a moment, they all sprang up with a cry and ran away screaming, for Barbaik had placed pans of hot coals under their feet, and all their poor little toes were burnt. \""You won't forget that in a hurry,\"" she said, smiling grimly to herself. But in a moment, they were back again with large pots of water, which they poured on the fire. Then they joined hands and danced around it, singing:\n\n          Wicked traitress, Barne Riou,\n          Our poor toes are burned by you;\n          Now we hurry from your hall\u2014\n          Bad luck light upon you all.\n\nThat evening, they left the country forever, and Jegu, without their help, grew poorer and poorer, and at last died of misery, while Barbaik was glad to find work in the market of Morlaix."""
7,The Magic Mirror,"""A long, long while ago, before ever the White Men were seen in Senna, there lived a man called Gopani-Kufa. One day, as he was out hunting, he came upon a strange sight. An enormous python had caught an antelope and coiled itself around it. The antelope, striking out in despair with its horns, had pinned the python's neck to a tree. So deeply had its horns sunk in the soft wood that neither creature could get away.\n\n\""Help!\"" cried the antelope, \""for I was doing no harm, yet I have been caught. I would have been eaten, had I not defended myself.\"" \""Help me,\"" said the python, \""for I am Insato, King of all the Reptiles, and will reward you well!\"" Gopani-Kufa considered for a moment, then stabbing the antelope with his assegai, he set the python free. \n\n\""I thank you,\"" said the python. \""Come back here with the new moon, when I shall have eaten the antelope, and I will reward you as I promised.\"" \""Yes,\"" said the dying antelope, \""he will reward you, and lo! your reward shall be your own undoing!\"" Gopani-Kufa went back to his kraal, and with the new moon, he returned again to the spot where he had saved the python.\n\nInsato was lying upon the ground, still sleepy from the effects of his huge meal, and when he saw the man, he thanked him again, saying, \""Come with me now to Pita, which is my own country, and I will give you what you will of all my possessions.\"" Gopani-Kufa at first was afraid, thinking of what the antelope had said, but finally he consented and followed Insato into the forest.\n\nFor several days they traveled, and at last, they came to a hole leading deep into the earth. It was not very wide, but large enough to admit a man. \""Hold on to my tail,\"" said Insato, \""and I will go down first, drawing you after me.\"" The man did so, and Insato entered. Down, down, down they went for days, all the while getting deeper and deeper into the earth, until at last, the darkness ended, and they dropped into a beautiful country. Around them grew short green grass, on which browsed herds of cattle and sheep and goats. In the distance, Gopani-Kufa saw a great collection of houses, all square, built of stone and very tall, and their roofs were shining with gold and burnished iron.\n\nGopani-Kufa turned to Insato but found, in the place of the python, a man, strong and handsome, with the great snake's skin wrapped around him for covering; and on his arms and neck were rings of pure gold. The man smiled. \""I am Insato,\"" said he, \""but in my own country, I take man's shape\u2014even as you see me\u2014for this is Pita, the land over which I am king.\"" He then took Gopani-Kufa by the hand and led him towards the town.\n\nOn the way, they passed rivers in which men and women were bathing and fishing and boating; and farther on, they came to gardens covered with heavy crops of rice and maize, and many other grains which Gopani-Kufa did not even know the name of. As they passed, the people who were singing at their work in the fields abandoned their labors and saluted Insato with delight, bringing also palm wine and green coconuts for refreshment, as to one returned from a long journey. \""These are my children!\"" said Insato, waving his hand towards the people. Gopani-Kufa was much astonished at all that he saw, but he said nothing. Presently they came to the town; everything here, too, was beautiful, and everything that a man might desire he could obtain. Even the grains of dust in the streets were of gold and silver.\n\nInsato conducted Gopani-Kufa to the palace, showing him his rooms and the maidens who would wait upon him. He told him that they would have a great feast that night, and on the morrow he might name his choice of the riches of Pita, and it should be given him. Then he was away. Now Gopani-Kufa had a wasp called Zengi-mizi. Zengi-mizi was not an ordinary wasp, for the spirit of the father of Gopani-Kufa had entered it, so that it was exceedingly wise. In times of doubt, Gopani-Kufa always consulted the wasp as to what had better be done, so on this occasion he took it out of the little rush basket in which he carried it, saying, \""Zengi-mizi, what gift shall I ask of Insato tomorrow when he would know the reward he shall bestow on me for saving his life?\""\n\n\""Biz-z-z,\"" hummed Zengi-mizi, \""ask him for Sipao the Mirror.\"" And it flew back into its basket. Gopani-Kufa was astonished at this answer, but knowing that the words of Zengi-mizi were true words, he determined to make the request. So that night they feasted, and on the morrow Insato came to Gopani-Kufa and, giving him greeting joyfully, said, \""Now, O my friend, name your choice amongst my possessions, and you shall have it!\"" \n\n\""O king!\"" answered Gopani-Kufa, \""out of all your possessions, I will have the Mirror, Sipao.\"" The king started. \""O friend, Gopani-Kufa,\"" he said, \""ask anything but that! I did not think that you would request that which is most precious to me.\"" \""Let me think over it again then, O king,\"" said Gopani-Kufa, \""and tomorrow I will let you know if I change my mind.\"" But the king was still much troubled, fearing the loss of Sipao, for the mirror had magic powers, so that he who owned it had but to ask, and his wish would be fulfilled; to it Insato owed all that he possessed.\n\nAs soon as the king left him, Gopani-Kufa again took Zengi-mizi out of his basket. \""Zengi-mizi,\"" he said, \""the king seems loth to grant my request for the Mirror\u2014is there not some other thing of equal value for which I might ask?\"" And the wasp answered, \""There is nothing in the world, O Gopani-Kufa, which is of such value as this Mirror, for it is a Wishing Mirror, and accomplishes the desires of him who owns it. If the king hesitates, go to him the next day, and the day after, and in the end, he will bestow the Mirror upon you, for you saved his life.\""\n\nAnd it was even so. For three days Gopani-Kufa returned the same answer to the king, and at last, with tears in his eyes, Insato gave him the Mirror, which was of polished iron, saying, \""Take Sipao, then, O Gopani-Kufa, and may thy wishes come true. Go back now to thine own country; Sipao will show you the way.\"" Gopani-Kufa was greatly rejoiced, and, taking farewell of the king, said to the Mirror, \""Sipao, Sipao, I wish to be back upon the Earth again!\"" Instantly he found himself standing upon the upper earth; but, not knowing the spot, he said again to the Mirror, \""Sipao, Sipao, I want the path to my own kraal!\"" And behold! right before him lay the path!\n\nWhen he arrived home, he found his wife and daughter mourning for him, for they thought that he had been eaten by lions; but he comforted them, saying that while following a wounded antelope, he had missed his way and had wandered for a long time before he had found the path again. That night he asked Zengi-mizi, in whom sat the spirit of his father, what he had better ask Sipao for next? \""Biz-z-z,\"" said the wasp, \""would you not like to be as great a chief as Insato?\"" And Gopani-Kufa smiled, and took the Mirror and said to it, \""Sipao, Sipao, I want a town as great as that of Insato, the King of Pita; and I wish to be chief over it!\""\n\nThen all along the banks of the Zambesi river, which flowed nearby, sprang up streets of stone buildings, and their roofs shone with gold and burnished iron like those in Pita; and in the streets, men and women were walking, and young boys were driving out the sheep and cattle to pasture; and from the river came shouts and laughter from the young men and maidens who had launched their canoes and were fishing. And when the people of the new town beheld Gopani-Kufa, they rejoiced greatly and hailed him as chief.\n\nGopani-Kufa was now as powerful as Insato the King of the Reptiles had been, and he and his family moved into the palace that stood high above the other buildings right in the middle of the town. His wife was too astonished at all these wonders to ask any questions, but his daughter Shasasa kept begging him to tell her how he had suddenly become so great; so at last he revealed the whole secret and even entrusted Sipao the Mirror to her care, saying, \""It will be safer with you, my daughter, for you dwell apart; whereas men come to consult me on affairs of state, and the Mirror might be stolen.\""\n\nThen Shasasa took the Magic Mirror and hid it beneath her pillow, and after that for many years, Gopani-Kufa ruled his people both well and wisely, so that all men loved him, and never once did he need to ask Sipao to grant him a wish. Now it happened that, after many years, when the hair of Gopani-Kufa was turning grey with age, there came white men to that country. Up the Zambesi they came, and they fought long and fiercely with Gopani-Kufa; but, because of the power of the Magic Mirror, he beat them, and they fled to the sea-coast. Chief among them was one Rei, a man of much cunning, who sought to discover whence sprang Gopani-Kufa's power. \n\nSo one day, he called to him a trusty servant named Butou and said, \""Go you to the town and find out for me what is the secret of its greatness.\"" And Butou, dressing himself in rags, set out, and when he came to Gopani-Kufa's town, he asked for the chief; and the people took him into the presence of Gopani-Kufa. When the white man saw him, he humbled himself and said, \""O Chief! take pity on me, for I have no home! When Rei marched against you, I alone stood apart, for I knew that all the strength of the Zambesi lay in your hands, and because I would not fight against you, he turned me forth into the forest to starve!\""\n\nAnd Gopani-Kufa believed the white man's story, and he took him in and feasted him, and gave him a house. In this way, the end came. For the heart of Shasasa, the daughter of Gopani-Kufa, went forth to Butou the traitor, and from her, he learned the secret of the Magic Mirror. One night, when all the town slept, he felt beneath her pillow and, finding the Mirror, he stole it and fled back with it to Rei, the chief of the white men.\n\nSo it befell that, one day, as Gopani-Kufa was gazing up at the river from a window of the palace, he again saw the war-canoes of the white men; and at the sight, his spirit misgave him. \""Shasasa! my daughter!\"" he cried wildly, \""go fetch me the mirror, for the white men are at hand.\"" \""Woe is me, my father!\"" she sobbed. \""The Mirror is gone! For I loved Butou the traitor, and he has stolen Sipao from me!\"" \n\nThen Gopani-Kufa calmed himself and drew out Zengi-mizi from its rush basket. \""O spirit of my father!\"" he said, \""what now shall I do?\"" \""O Gopani-Kufa!\"" hummed the wasp, \""there is nothing now that can be done, for the words of the antelope which you slew are being fulfilled.\"" \""Alas! I am an old man\u2014I had forgotten!\"" cried the chief. \""The words of the antelope were true words\u2014my reward shall be my undoing\u2014they are being fulfilled!\""\n\nThen the white men fell upon the people of Gopani-Kufa and slew them together with the chief and his daughter Shasasa; and since then, all the power of the Earth has rested in the hands of the white men, for they have in their possession Sipao, the Magic Mirror."""
8,Black Arts,"""The wild people who dwell in the South-West are masters of many black arts. They often lure men of the Middle Kingdom to their country by promising them their daughters in marriage, but their promises are not to be trusted. Once, there was the son of a poor family who agreed to labor for three years for one of the wild men in order to become his son-in-law.\n\nAt the end of that time, the wedding was celebrated, and the couple were given a little house for a home. However, no sooner had they entered it than the wife warned her husband to be on his guard, since her parents did not like him and would seek to do him harm. In accordance with custom, she entered the house first with a lighted lantern, but when the bridegroom followed her, she had disappeared. This strange occurrence continued day by day; during the daytime she was there, but when evening came, she vanished.\n\nOne day, not long after they had been married, his wife said to him, \""Tomorrow morning my mother celebrates her birthday, and you must go to congratulate her. They will offer you tea and food. The tea you may drink, but be sure not to touch any of the food. Keep this in mind!\"" The following day, the wife and husband went to her mother's home and offered their congratulations. Her parents seemed highly pleased and served them with tea and sweets. The son-in-law drank but ate nothing, despite his wife's parents urging him to help himself. Eventually, he thought they could mean him no ill and, seeing the fresh-caught eels and crabs on the plate before him, he ate a little.\n\nHis wife gave him a reproachful glance, and he offered some excuse to take his leave. However, his mother-in-law insisted, \""This is my birthday. You simply must taste my birthday noodles!\"" She placed a great dish before him, filled with noodles that looked like threads of silver, mingled with fat meat and spiced with fragrant mushrooms. The dish was so appetizing that he could not resist raising his chopsticks, despite his wife's significant coughs and the pressure of her foot on his. He pretended not to see her warnings and, unable to resist, he ate until he claimed, \""My hunger is satisfied,\"" and took his leave with his wife.\n\n\""This is a serious matter,\"" said the latter. \""You would not listen to my words, and now you will surely have to die!\"" Still, he did not believe her until he suddenly felt terrible pains that grew unbearable, causing him to fall unconscious. His wife quickly hung him up by the feet from the beam of the roof, placed a panful of glowing charcoal under him, and set a jar of water mixed with sesame oil in front of the fire, directly below his mouth. When the fire had heated him thoroughly, he opened his mouth, and a squirming, crawling mass of poisonous worms, centipedes, toads, and tadpoles fell into the jar of water. After untieing him and giving him wine mingled with realgar, he recovered.\n\n\""What you ate in the belief that they were eels and crabs,\"" said his wife, \""were nothing but toads and tadpoles, and the birthday noodles were poisonous worms and centipedes. But you must continue to be careful. My parents know that you have not died, and they will think up other evil plans.\"" A few days later, his father-in-law commanded him, \""There is a large tree growing on the precipice which juts over the cave. In it is the nest of the phoenix. You are still young and able to climb, so go there quickly and fetch me the eggs!\""\n\nHis son-in-law went home and told his wife. \""Take long bamboo poles,\"" she instructed, \""tie them together, and fasten a curved sword at the top. Take these nine loaves of bread and these hens' eggs\u2014there are seven times seven of them. Carry them along with you in a basket. When you come to the spot, you will see a large nest up in the branches. Do not climb the tree, but chop it down with the curved sword. Then throw away your poles and run for dear life. Should a monster appear and follow you, throw him the loaves of bread, three loaves at a time, and finally throw down the eggs on the ground and make for home as quickly as you can. In this way, you may escape the danger which threatens you.\""\n\nThe man noted all she said and went. Sure enough, he saw the bird's nest\u2014it was as large as a round pavilion. He tied his curved sword to the poles, chopped at the tree with all his strength, laid down his poles, and ran for dear life. Suddenly, he heard the roaring of a thunderstorm rising above him. When he looked up, he saw a great dragon, many fathoms long and some ten feet across, with eyes gleaming like lamps and spitting fire and flame. The dragon stretched out two feelers and began feeling along the ground. The man swiftly flung the loaves into the air.\n\nThe dragon caught them, but no sooner had the man gained a few steps than the dragon came flying after him again. He flung more loaves, and when they ran out, he turned over his basket so that the eggs rolled onto the ground. The dragon, still hungry, opened his greedy jaws wide. When he caught sight of the eggs, he descended from the air, and since the eggs were scattered, it took time for him to suck them all. In the meantime, the man succeeded in escaping to his home.\n\nWhen he entered the door and saw his wife, he said amid sobs, \""It was all I could do to escape, and I am lucky not to be in the dragon's stomach! If this sort of thing keeps up much longer, I am bound to die!\"" With these words, he kneeled and begged his wife pitifully to save his life. \""Where is your home?\"" she asked. \""My home is about a hundred miles away from here, in the Middle Kingdom, and my old mother is still living. The only thing that worries me is that we are so poor.\""\n\nHis wife replied, \""I will flee with you, and we will find your mother. And waste no regrets on your poverty.\"" With that, she gathered up all the household's pearls and precious stones, put them in a bag, and had her husband tie it around his waist. She also gave him an umbrella, and in the middle of the night, they climbed the wall with the aid of a ladder and stole away.\n\nHis wife instructed him, \""Take the umbrella on your back and run as fast as ever you can! Do not open it, and do not look around! I will follow you in secret.\"" He turned North and ran with all his might. After a day and a night, having covered nearly a hundred miles and passed the boundaries of the wild people's country, his legs gave out, and he grew hungry. Before him lay a mountain village. He stopped at the village gate to rest, drew some food from his pocket, and began to eat, but he could not see his wife.\n\nHe thought to himself, \""Perhaps she has deceived me after all and is not coming with me!\"" After finishing his meal, he took a drink from a spring and painfully dragged himself further. When the heat of the day was greatest, a violent mountain rain suddenly began to fall. In his haste, he forgot his wife's warning and opened his umbrella, causing her to fall out onto the ground.\n\nShe reproached him, \""Once more you have not listened to my advice. Now the damage has been done!\"" Quickly, she told him to go to the village and buy a white cock, seven black tea-cups, and half a length of red nettlecloth. \""Do not be sparing of the silver pieces in your pocket!\"" she cried after him as he went off.\n\nHe attended to everything and returned. The woman tore the cloth apart, made a coat of it, and put it on. No sooner had they walked a few miles than they could see a red cloud rising up in the South, like a flying bird. \""That is my mother,\"" said the woman. In a moment, the cloud was overhead. She took the black tea-cups and threw them at it. Seven she threw, and seven fell to earth again. They could hear her mother in the cloud weeping and scolding, and then the cloud disappeared.\n\nThey continued on for about four hours when they heard a sound like silk being torn and saw a cloud as black as ink rushing against the wind. \""Alas, that is my father!\"" said the woman. \""This is a matter of life and death, for he will not let us be! Because of my love for you, I will now have to disobey the holiest of laws!\"" With that, she seized the white cock, separated its head from its body, and flung the head into the air. Instantly, the black cloud dissolved, and her father's body, head severed from the trunk, fell by the edge of the road. The woman wept bitterly, and after she had wept her fill, they buried the corpse.\n\nTogether, they went to her husband's home, where they found his old mother still living. They undid the bag of pearls and jewels, bought a piece of good ground, built a fine house, and became wealthy and respected members of the community."""
9,Dschang Liang,"""Dschang Liang was a native of one of those states which had been destroyed by the Emperor Tsin Schi Huang. Determined to avenge his dead king, Dschang Liang gathered followers with the intent to slay Tsin Schi Huang. His opportunity arose when the Emperor was making a progress through the country. As Tsin Schi Huang reached the plain of Bo Lang, Dschang Liang armed his people with iron maces, ready to confront him. However, Tsin Schi Huang had a clever ruse; he traveled in two identical coaches, one of which he occupied while the other contained a decoy. Dschang Liang and his followers mistakenly attacked the decoy wagon, forcing him to flee from the Emperor's wrath.\n\nIn his escape, Dschang Liang came upon a ruined bridge, where an icy wind blew and snowflakes whirled through the air. There, he encountered an old man dressed in a black turban and a yellow gown. The old man accidentally dropped one of his shoes into the water and, looking at Dschang Liang, said, \""Fetch it out, little one!\"" Dschang Liang, despite the dire circumstances, controlled himself, retrieved the shoe, and returned it to the old man. Pleased by this act of respect, the old man remarked, \""Little one, something may be made of you! Come here tomorrow morning early, and I will have something for you.\""\n\nThe following morning, Dschang Liang arrived at dawn, but the old man reproached him for being late, stating, \""To-day I will tell you nothing. To-morrow you must come earlier.\"" This pattern continued for three days, yet Dschang Liang's patience never wavered. Finally, the old man was satisfied and presented him with the Book of Hidden Complements. \""You must read it,\"" he instructed, \""and then you will be able to rule a great emperor. When your task is completed, seek me at the foot of the Gu Tschong Mountain. There you will find a yellow stone, and I will be by that yellow stone.\""\n\nDschang Liang took the book and aided the ancestor of the Han dynasty in conquering the empire, earning the title of count. From that moment on, he abstained from human food and focused his spirit. He spent time with the four whitebeards of the Shang Mountain, sharing in the beauty of sunset roses among the clouds. During this time, he encountered two boys singing and dancing, who sang, \""Green the garments you should wear, If to heaven's gate you'd fare; There the Golden Mother greet, Bow before the Wood Lord's feet!\"" \n\nUpon hearing this, Dschang Liang bowed before the youths and explained to his friends the significance of their song. He described the Golden Mother as the Queen of the West and the Lord of Wood as the King Father of the East, the primal powers responsible for creation and nourishment. He emphasized that to gain immortality, one must first greet the Golden Mother and bow before the King Father, thus opening the path to the three Pure Ones and the presence of the Highest.\n\nAs time passed, the emperor was persuaded to have some of his loyal servants executed. Disturbed by this, Dschang Liang left the emperor's service and journeyed to Gu Tschong Mountain. There, he found the old man by the yellow stone, acquired the hidden knowledge, and returned home. Feigning illness, he managed to release his soul from his body and vanished from the mortal realm.\n\nLater, during the rebellion of the \""Red Eyebrows,\"" Dschang Liang's tomb was opened, revealing only a yellow stone within. Meanwhile, Dschang Liang was wandering with Laotsze in the invisible world. Eventually, his grandson Dschang Dau Ling traveled to Kunlun Mountain to visit the Queen Mother of the West, where he encountered Dschang Liang. Dschang Dau Ling gained power over demons and spirits, ultimately becoming the first Taoist pope. The secret of his power has since been passed down through generations in his family."""
10,Giauna The Beautiful,"""Once upon a time, there was a descendant of Confucius. His father had a friend who held an official position in the South and offered the young man a place as secretary. However, when the young man reached the town where he was to have been active, he found that his father's friend had already died. This left him much embarrassed, as he did not have the means to return home. Grateful for a place to stay, he took refuge in the Monastery of Puto, where he copied holy books for the abbot.\n\nAbout a hundred paces west of the monastery stood a deserted house. One day, after a great snowfall, young Kung accidentally passed by the door of the house and noticed a well-dressed and prepossessing youth standing there. The youth bowed to him and begged him to approach. As a scholar, young Kung appreciated good manners, and finding that they had much in common, he took a liking to the youth and followed him into the house. Inside, it was immaculately clean, with silk curtains hanging before the doors and pictures of good old masters on the walls. On a table lay a book entitled \""Tales of the Coral Ring,\"" which referred to a cavern.\n\nOnce upon a time, a monk at Puto who was exceedingly learned had been led into the cave in question by an aged man. Inside, he had seen numerous volumes on book stands, and the aged man had explained that these were the histories of various dynasties. In another room were the histories of all the peoples on earth, while a third room was guarded by two dogs, which the aged man claimed were two dragons. The monk had turned the pages of the ancient works, wishing to remain in the cave, but the old man insisted he leave. The cave was known as the Coral Ring, and it was described in the volume lying on the table.\n\nThe youth questioned Kung about his name and family, and Kung shared his whole history. The youth expressed pity for him and advised him to open a school. Kung sighed, saying, \""I am quite unknown in the neighborhood and have no one to recommend me!\"" The youth then offered, \""If you do not consider me altogether too unworthy and stupid, I would like to be your pupil myself.\"" Overjoyed, Kung replied, \""I should not dare to attempt to teach you, but together we might dedicate ourselves to the study of science.\"" He then inquired why the house had been empty for so long.\n\nThe youth explained, \""The owner of the house has gone to the country. We come from Shensi and have taken the house for a short time. We only moved in a few days ago.\"" They chatted and joked together gaily, and the young man invited Kung to stay overnight, ordering a small boy to light a pan of charcoal. Shortly after, he stepped into the rear room and returned, saying, \""My father has come.\""\n\nAs Kung rose, an aged man with a long white beard and eyebrows entered the room, greeting him with gratitude for his willingness to instruct his son. The aged man insisted that Kung must be strict with his son and not treat him as a friend. He then had garments of silk, a fur cap, and shoes and socks of fur brought in, urging Kung to change his clothes. Wine and food were served, and the cushions and covers of the tables and chairs were made of materials unknown to Kung, their shimmering radiance blinding his eyes. After a few beakers of wine, the aged man retired, and the youth showed Kung his essays, all written in the style of the old masters rather than the new-fangled eight-section form.\n\nWhen Kung inquired about this, the youth smiled and said, \""I am quite indifferent to winning success at the state examinations!\"" He then instructed the small boy to check if the old gentleman had fallen asleep, and if so, to quietly bring in little Hiang-Nu. The boy went off, and the youth took a lute from an embroidered case. A serving-maid dressed in red and surpassingly beautiful entered, and the youth asked her to sing \""The Lament of the Beloved,\"" her melting tones moving the heart. The third watch of the night had passed before they finally retired to sleep.\n\nThe following morning, all rose early, and study began. The youth proved exceptionally gifted, making surprising progress in just a few months. They followed the old custom of writing an essay every five days, celebrating its completion with a little banquet, at which Hiang-Nu was always present. One evening, Kung found himself unable to remove his gaze from Hiang-Nu. The youth, sensing his thoughts, remarked, \""You are as yet unmarried. I keep thinking about how I can provide you with a charming life companion. Hiang-Nu is my father's serving-maid, so I cannot give her to you.\""\n\nKung expressed his gratitude for the thought but added, \""If the girl you have in mind is not just as beautiful as Hiang-Nu, then I would rather do without.\"" The youth laughed, \""You are indeed inexperienced if you think that Hiang-Nu is beautiful. Your wish is easily fulfilled.\"" Thus, half a year passed, and the monotonous rainy season began. Then, a swelling the size of a peach developed in young Kung's breast, increasing overnight until it was as large as a teacup. He lay on his couch groaning with pain, unable to eat or sleep. The youth busied himself day and night nursing him, and even the old gentleman inquired about his condition.\n\nThe youth then said, \""My little sister Giauna alone is able to cure this illness. Please send for grandmother and have her brought here!\"" The old gentleman agreed and sent off his boy. The next day, the boy returned with news that Giauna would come, accompanied by her aunt and cousin A-Sung. Shortly after, the youth led his sister into the room. She was no more than thirteen or fourteen years old, enchantingly beautiful and slender as a willow tree. Upon seeing her, the sick man forgot all his pain, and his spirits lifted.\n\nThe youth introduced his sister Giauna, saying, \""This is my best friend, whom I love as a brother! I beg of you, little sister, to cure him of his illness!\"" The maiden blushed with confusion and stepped up to the sickbed. As she felt his pulse, it seemed to Kung that she brought the fragrance of orchards with her. She smiled and said, \""No wonder this illness has befallen him. His heart beats far too stormily. His illness is serious but not incurable. Now that the blood has flowed, we will have to cut to cure.\""\n\nWith that, she took her golden armlet from her arm and laid it on the aching place, pressing it down gently. The swelling rose a full inch above the armlet, enclosing the entire swelling. She then retrieved a pen-knife with a blade as thin as paper from her silken girdle. Holding the armlet with one hand and the knife with the other, she lightly passed it around the bottom of the ring. Black blood gushed forth, running over the mattress and bed. Yet, young Kung was so enchanted by the presence of the beautiful Giauna that he felt no pain; his only fear was that the whole affair might end too soon, and she would disappear from his sight.\n\nIn a moment, the diseased flesh had been cut away, and Giauna had fresh water brought to cleanse the wound. She took a small red pellet from her mouth and laid it on the wound. As she turned in a circle, it seemed to Kung as though she drew out all the inflammation in steam and flames. After turning for the third time, he found himself completely cured. The maiden took the pellet back into her mouth and declared, \""Now all is well!\"" before hastening into the inner room. Young Kung leaped up to thank her.\n\nThough he was now cured, his thoughts continued to dwell on Giauna's pretty face. He neglected his books and sat lost in daydreams. His friend noticed this and said, \""I have at last succeeded in finding an attractive life companion for you.\"" Kung inquired who she might be. \""The daughter of my aunt, A-Sung. She is seventeen years of age and anything but homely.\"" Kung thought to himself that she was surely not as beautiful as Giauna. He then hummed the lines of a song to himself:\n\n\""Who once has seen the sea close by,  \nAll rivers shallow streams declares;  \nWho o'er Wu's hill the clouds watched fly,  \nSays nothing with that view compares.\""\n\nThe youth smiled and said, \""My little sister Giauna is still very young. Besides, she is my father's only daughter, and he would not like to see her marry someone from afar. But my cousin A-Sung is not homely either. If you do not believe me, wait until they go walking in the garden, and then you may take a look at them without their knowing it.\""\n\nKung positioned himself at the open window, and sure enough, he saw Giauna come along leading another girl by the hand, a girl so beautiful that there was none other like her. Giauna and the girl seemed to be sisters, only distinguishable by a slight difference in age. Young Kung was exceedingly happy and begged his friend to act for him in arranging the marriage, which the latter promised to do. The next day, he came to Kung with congratulations, announcing that everything was arranged. A special court was prepared for the young pair, and the wedding was celebrated. Young Kung felt as though he had married a fairy, and the two became very fond of each other.\n\nOne day, Kung's friend came to him in a state of great excitement, saying, \""The owner of this house is coming back, and my father now wishes to return to Shensi. The time for us to part draws near, and I am very sad!\"" Kung wished to accompany them, but his friend advised him to return to his own home. Kung mentioned the difficulties in the way, but the youth replied, \""That need not worry you, because I will accompany you.\""\n\nAfter some time, the father arrived, along with A-Sung, and made Kung a present of a hundred ounces of gold. The youth then took Kung and his wife by the hand, instructing them to close their eyes. As soon as they did, they were whisked away through the air like a storm wind. All Kung could notice was the gale roaring about his ears. After some time, the youth exclaimed, \""Now we have arrived!\"" Kung opened his eyes to see his old home, realizing that his friend was not of human kind.\n\nGaily, they knocked at the door of his home. His mother opened it, and upon seeing that he had brought along such a charming wife, she was greatly pleased. Kung turned to thank his friend, but the latter had already disappeared. A-Sung served her mother-in-law with great devotion, and her beauty and virtue were celebrated far and wide. Soon after, young Kung gained the doctorate and was appointed inspector of prisons in Shensi. He took his wife along with him, but his mother remained at home, as Shensi was too far for her to travel. Heaven blessed A-Sung and Kung with a little son.\n\nHowever, Kung became involved in a dispute with a traveling censor. The latter complained about Kung, leading to his dismissal from his post. One day, while idling about before the city, he saw a handsome youth riding a black mule. Upon closer inspection, he recognized it as his old friend. They embraced, laughing and weeping, and the youth led him to a village. In the midst of a thick grove of trees that cast deep shade, stood a house whose upper stories rose to the skies, indicating that people of distinction lived there. Kung inquired after sister Giauna and learned that she had married.\n\nHe stayed overnight and then went off to fetch his wife. In the meantime, Giauna arrived, taking A-Sung's little son in her arms and saying, \""Cousin, this is a little stranger in our family!\"" Kung greeted her and thanked her again for the kindness she had shown him in curing his illness. She smiled and replied, \""Since then you have become a distinguished man, and the wound has long since healed. Have you still not forgotten your pain?\""\n\nThen Giauna's husband arrived, and everyone became acquainted. After that, they parted ways. One day, the youth came to Kung with a sad expression, saying, \""We are threatened by a great misfortune today. I do not know whether you would be willing to save us!\"" Kung, unsure of what it might be, gladly promised his aid. The youth then gathered the entire family, and they bowed down in the outer court.\n\nHe began, \""I will tell you the truth just as it is. We are foxes. Today, we are threatened by the danger of thunder. If you care to save us, then there is hope that we may manage to stay alive; if not, then take your child and go, so that you are not involved in our danger.\"" Kung vowed that he would share life and death with them. The youth then instructed him to stand in the door with a sword in his hand, saying, \""Now when the thunder begins to roll, you must stand there and never stir.\""\n\nSuddenly, dark clouds rose in the sky, and the heavens grew gloomy as if night were closing in. Kung looked around, but the buildings had all disappeared, and behind him, he could only see a high barrow with a large cave whose interior was lost in darkness. In the midst of his fright, he was startled by a thunderbolt. A heavy rain poured down in streams, and a storm wind arose, uprooting the tallest trees. Everything glimmered before his eyes, and his ears were deafened. Yet, he held his sword in hand and stood as firm as a rock.\n\nAmidst the black smoke and flashes of lightning, he saw a monster with a pointed beak and long claws, carrying off a human body. Upon closer inspection, he recognized the dress of Giauna. He leaped at the monster and struck at it with his sword, causing Giauna to fall to the ground. A tremendous crash of thunder shook the earth, and Kung fell down dead.\n\nWhen the tempest cleared, the blue sky reappeared. Giauna regained consciousness, and upon seeing Kung lying dead beside her, she sobbed, \""He died for my sake! Why should I continue to live?\"" A-Sung also emerged, and together they carried him into the cave. Giauna instructed A-Sung to hold his head while her brother opened his mouth. She took hold of his chin, brought out her little red pellet, pressed it against his lips with her own, and breathed into his lungs. Soon, breath returned to his throat with a rattling noise, and in a short time, he was himself once more.\n\nThe whole family was reunited, and none of its members had come to harm. They gradually recovered from their fright and were quite happy when suddenly a small boy brought news that Giauna's husband and his whole family had been killed by the thunder. Giauna broke down, weeping, and the others tried to comfort her. Finally, Kung said, \""It is not well to dwell too long amid the graves of the dead. Will you not come home with me?\""\n\nThey packed their belongings and went with him. Kung assigned a deserted garden, which he carefully walled off, to his friend and his family as a dwelling place. Only when Kung and A-Sung came to visit them was the bolt drawn. Then Giauna and her brother played chess, drank tea, and chatted with them like members of the same family. However, Kung's little son had a somewhat pointed face resembling a fox's, and when he walked along the street, people would turn around and say, \""There goes the fox-child!\"""""
12, How The River Gods Wedding Was Broken Off,"""At the time of the seven empires, there lived a man by the name of Si-Men Bau, who served as a governor on the Yellow River. In this district, the river-god was held in high honor, and the local sorcerers and witches proclaimed that every year, the river-god sought a bride from among the people. If a suitable girl was not found, they warned, wind and rain would not come at the proper seasons, leading to scanty crops and devastating floods. Consequently, when a girl from a wealthy family came of age, the sorcerers would declare her the chosen one. To protect their daughters, the parents would bribe the sorcerers with large sums of money to select someone else. Eventually, the sorcerers would coerce the wealthy families to share the expense of purchasing a poor girl to be cast into the river, keeping the remainder of the money as profit. Those who refused to pay would see their daughters chosen as the river-god's bride, forced to accept the wedding gifts brought by the sorcerers. The people of the district grew increasingly resentful of this cruel custom.\n\nUpon taking office, Si-Men became aware of this evil practice and summoned the sorcerers to appear before him. He expressed his desire to be informed when the day of the river-god's wedding arrived, stating that he wished to honor the god in person, believing that this would please the deity and bring blessings upon his people. The sorcerers, pleased by his apparent piety, agreed to notify him when the time came.\n\nWhen the day of the wedding arrived, the sorcerers informed Si-Men, who dressed in his ceremonial robes and entered his chariot for a grand procession to the river. The elders of the community, along with the sorcerers and witches, gathered to witness the event, and people from far and wide flocked to see the spectacle. The sorcerers placed the river-bride on a couch, adorning her with bridal jewels, while kettledrums, snaredrums, and merry airs filled the air with joyful sounds.\n\nAs they prepared to thrust the couch into the stream, the girl's parents bid her farewell amidst tears. However, Si-Men intervened, urging them to wait. He insisted that he had come in person to escort the bride, and everything must be done solemnly and in order. He declared that someone must go to the river-god's castle to inform him to come and fetch his bride. Si-Men then pointed to a witch and commanded her to go. The witch hesitated, but Si-Men ordered his servants to seize her and cast her into the river. After an hour passed without her return, Si-Men remarked that she must not have understood her task.\n\nNext, he turned to one of the sorcerers, insisting that he go and do better. The sorcerer, pale with fear, was also seized and thrown into the river. Another half-hour passed, and Si-Men feigned unease, claiming that both had failed in their errand and were causing the bride to wait in vain. He then looked at another sorcerer and commanded him to go and find the others. This sorcerer, terrified, flung himself on the ground, begging for mercy. The rest of the sorcerers and witches knelt before Si-Men, pleading for grace and swearing an oath that they would never again seek a bride for the river-god.\n\nWith a wave of his hand, Si-Men sent the girl back to her home, effectively putting an end to the evil custom forever. The people rejoiced, grateful for the governor's intervention and the liberation from the oppressive tradition."""
13,Notscha,"""The oldest daughter of the Ruler of Heaven had married the great general Li Dsing. Her sons were named Gintscha, Mutscha, and Notscha. However, when Notscha was born, his mother had a vivid dream in which a Taoist priest entered her chamber and urged her to \""swiftly receive the Heavenly Son.\"" Upon waking, she felt a radiant pearl glowing within her. When Notscha came into the world, it appeared as though a ball of flesh was turning in circles like a wheel, filling the room with strange fragrances and a crimson light.\n\nLi Dsing was frightened and thought it was an apparition. In a panic, he clove the circling ball with his sword, and out of it leaped a small boy whose body glowed with a crimson radiance. The boy's face was delicately shaped and white as snow, adorned with a golden armlet on his right arm and crimson silk around his thighs. Upon seeing the child, Li Dsing felt pity and refrained from slaying him, while his wife began to love the boy dearly.\n\nThree days later, friends came to celebrate the birth, and during the festival meal, a Taoist priest entered, declaring himself the Great One. He proclaimed that the boy was the bright Pearl of the Beginning of Things, bestowed upon them as their son. However, he warned that the boy was wild and unruly, destined to kill many men, and offered to take him as his pupil to temper his savage ways. Li Dsing bowed in gratitude, and the Great One vanished.\n\nAt the age of seven, Notscha ran away from home and found himself at the river of nine bends, where he cooled off in the water. While washing his crimson silk cloth, he inadvertently shook the castle of the Dragon-King of the Eastern Sea, causing the king to send a Triton to investigate. The Triton scolded Notscha, who merely remarked on the creature's strange appearance. Enraged, the Triton attacked, but Notscha deftly avoided the blow and struck the Triton with his golden armlet, killing him instantly.\n\nNotscha laughed at the sight, but soon the Dragon-King sent his son to capture the boy. When the dragon youth confronted Notscha, a fierce battle ensued. Notscha, refusing to back down, cast his crimson cloth into the air, dazzling like a ball of fire, and defeated the dragon youth, revealing him as a golden dragon before slaying him. Notscha then decided to take the dragon's sinew home as a trophy.\n\nMeanwhile, the furious Dragon-King confronted Li Dsing, demanding Notscha's punishment. Li Dsing, believing his son too young to be guilty, was caught in a heated argument with the king. Just then, Notscha returned, proudly presenting the dragon's sinew. The Dragon-King, enraged, threatened to report Li Dsing to the Ruler of Heaven before storming off.\n\nLi Dsing and his wife were distraught, and Notscha, seeking guidance, went to his master, the Great One. The master advised him to prevent the dragon from accusing him in Heaven. Using magic, Notscha found himself at the gate of Heaven, where he ambushed the dragon and forced him to promise not to complain about him before letting him go. The dragon, however, transformed into a little green snake, swearing vengeance on Li Dsing before disappearing.\n\nLi Dsing, now genuinely angry with Notscha, sent him away to avoid further conflict. Notscha sought his master's advice again, and upon returning home, he found that the Dragon Kings had bound his parents in a tumultuous gathering. Notscha bravely offered to take the punishment for his actions, declaring his parents blameless. The dragons demanded \""life for life,\"" and Notscha, in despair, destroyed himself, leaving his mother to mourn him.\n\nHowever, Notscha's spirit fluttered to the Great One's cave, where he was told to appear to his mother and instruct her to build a shrine for him. After three years of incense and adoration, he would regain a human body. Notscha appeared to his mother in a dream, but when Li Dsing learned of it, he dismissed her concerns, believing it was merely her imagination. Despite his father's anger, Notscha continued to appear to her, urging her to build the shrine in secret.\n\nAs time passed, Notscha performed miracles in his temple, drawing worshippers from far and wide. One day, while passing by, Li Dsing learned of the new god and, upon discovering it was Notscha, grew furious. He destroyed the idol and burned the temple, returning home satisfied. When Notscha found his temple in ruins, he rushed to his master, who was outraged by Li Dsing's actions. The Great One created a new body for Notscha from lotus plants and infused it with life, allowing him to rise again as a small boy.\n\nWith newfound powers, Notscha sought revenge on Li Dsing. He pursued his father, who fled in fear. Mutscha, Notscha's brother, attempted to intervene but was quickly overpowered. Just as Notscha was about to catch Li Dsing, the holy Wen Dschu intervened, hiding Li Dsing in his cave. Notscha demanded his father be handed over, but Wen Dschu refused, leading to a fierce confrontation. Ultimately, Notscha was subdued and bound to a golden column, forced to endure a beating from Gintscha, his older brother.\n\nIn his moment of desperation, Notscha called out to the Great One for help, but the master did not respond. Instead, he thanked Wen Dschu for teaching Notscha a lesson. Eventually, Notscha was summoned to reconcile with his father, but as soon as he was free, he resumed his pursuit. This time, the old Buddha of the Radiance of the Light intervened, trapping Notscha in a fiery pagoda until he promised to obey his father.\n\nAfter fulfilling his promise, Notscha was released, and the Buddha gifted the pagoda to Li Dsing, teaching him a magic incantation to maintain control over Notscha. With this newfound power, Li Dsing and his three sons aided King Wu of the Dschou dynasty in defeating the tyrant Dschou-Sin. Their might was unmatched, and even when Notscha was wounded by a sorcerer, the Great One healed him and granted him extraordinary powers, transforming him into a being with three heads and eight arms.\n\nWith his new abilities, Notscha became even stronger, and after the defeat of Dschou-Sin, Li Dsing and his sons were taken up into heaven, seated among the gods, their legacy forever etched in the annals of celestial history."""
14,Rose Of Evening,"""On the fifth day of the fifth month, the festival of the Dragon Junk is held along the Yangtze-kiang. A dragon is hollowed out of wood, painted with an armor of scales, and adorned with gold and bright colors. A carved red railing surrounds this ship, and its sails and flags are made of silks and brocade. The after part of the vessel is called the dragon's tail, which rises ten feet above the water, with a board floating in the water tied to it by means of a cloth. Upon this board sit boys who turn somersaults, stand on their heads, and perform all sorts of tricks. Yet, being so close to the water, their danger is very great. It is the custom, therefore, when a boy is hired for this purpose, to give his parents money before he is trained. Then, if he falls into the water and is drowned, no one has him on their conscience. Farther South, the custom differs in so much that instead of boys, beautiful girls are chosen for this purpose.\n\nIn Dschen-Giang, there once lived a widow named Dsiang, who had a son called Aduan. When he was no more than seven years of age, he was extraordinarily skillful, and no other boy could equal him. As his reputation increased, he earned more and more money. So it happened that he was still called upon at the Dragon Junk Festival when he was already sixteen. However, one day he fell into the water below the Gold Island and drowned. He was the only son of his mother, and she sorrowed over him, and that was the end of it.\n\nYet Aduan did not know that he had been drowned. He met two men who took him along with them, and he saw a new world in the midst of the waters of the Yellow River. The waves of the river towered steeply about him like walls, and a palace was visible, in which sat a man wearing armor and a helmet. His two companions said to him, \""That is the Prince of the Dragon's Cave!\"" and bade him kneel. The Prince of the Dragon's Cave seemed to be of a mild and kindly disposition and said, \""We can make use of such a skillful lad. He may take part in the dance of the willow branches!\""\n\nAduan was brought to a spot surrounded by extensive buildings. He entered and was greeted by a crowd of boys who were all about fourteen years of age. An old woman came in, and they all called out, \""This is Mother Hia!\"" She sat down and had Aduan show his tricks. Then she taught him the dance of the flying thunders of Tsian-Tang River and the music that calms the winds on the sea of Dung-Ting. When the cymbals and kettledrums reechoed through all the courts, they deafened the ear. Mother Hia thought that Aduan would not be able to grasp everything the very first time, so she taught him with great patience. But Aduan understood everything from the first, and that pleased old Mother Hia. \""This boy,\"" said she, \""equals our own Rose of Evening!\""\n\nThe following day, the Prince of the Dragon's Cave held a review of his dancers. When all the dancers had assembled, the dance of the Ogres was performed first. Those who danced wore devil-masks and garments of scales, beating upon enormous cymbals, and their kettledrums were so large that four men could just about span them. Their sound was like the sound of mighty thunder, and the noise was so great that nothing else could be heard. When the dance began, tremendous waves spouted up to the very skies and then fell down again like star-glimmer scattering in the air.\n\nThe Prince of the Dragon Cave hastily bade the dance cease and had the dancers of the nightingale round step forth. These were lovely young girls of sixteen, who made delicate music with flutes, so that the breeze blew and the roaring of the waves was stilled in a moment. The water gradually became as quiet as a crystal world, transparent to its lowest depths. When the nightingale dancers had finished, they withdrew and posted themselves in the western courtyard. Then came the turn of the swallow dancers, who were all little girls. One among them, about fifteen years of age, danced the dance of the giving of flowers with flying sleeves and waving locks. As their garments fluttered, many-colored flowers dropped from their folds, caught up by the wind and whirled about the whole courtyard. When the dance ended, this dancer also went off with the rest of the girls to the western courtyard. Aduan looked at her from the corner of his eye and fell deeply in love with her. He asked his comrades who she might be, and they told him she was named \""Rose of Evening.\""\n\nBut the willow-spray dancers were now called out. The Prince of the Dragon Cave was especially desirous of testing Aduan. So Aduan danced alone, dancing with joy or defiance according to the music. When he looked up and down, his glances held the beat of the measure. The Dragon Prince, enchanted with his skill, presented him with a garment of five colors and gave him a carbuncle set in golden threads of fish-beard for a hair-jewel. Aduan bowed his thanks for the gift and then hastened to the western courtyard. There, all the dancers stood in rank and file. Aduan could only look at Rose of Evening from a distance, but still, Rose of Evening returned his glances.\n\nAfter a time, Aduan gradually slipped to the end of his file, and Rose of Evening also drew near to him, so that they stood only a few feet away from each other. However, the strict rules allowed no confusion in the ranks, so they could only gaze and let their souls go out to each other. Now the butterfly dance followed the others, danced by the boys and girls together, with pairs equal in size, age, and the color of their garments. When all the dances had ended, the dancers marched out with the goose-step. The willow-spray dancers followed the swallow dancers, and Aduan hastened in advance of his company, while Rose of Evening lingered along after hers. She turned her head, and when she spied Aduan, she purposely let a coral pin fall from her hair. Aduan hastily hid it in his sleeve.\n\nWhen he returned, he was sick with longing and could neither eat nor sleep. Mother Hia brought him all sorts of dainties, looked after him three or four times a day, and stroked his forehead with loving care. But his illness did not yield in the least. Mother Hia was unhappy and yet helpless. \""The birthday of the King of the Wu River is at hand,\"" said she. \""What is to be done?\""\n\nIn the twilight, a boy came, sitting down on the edge of Aduan's bed and chatting with him. He belonged to the butterfly dancers and asked casually, \""Are you sick because of Rose of Evening?\"" Aduan, frightened, asked him how he came to guess it. The other boy smiled and said, \""Well, because Rose of Evening is in the same case as yourself.\"" Disconcerted, Aduan sat up and begged the boy to advise him. \""Are you able to walk?\"" asked the latter. \""If I exert myself,\"" said Aduan, \""I think I could manage it.\"" So the boy led him to the South. There, he opened a gate, and they turned the corner to the West. Once more, the doors of the gate flew open, and Aduan saw a lotus field about twenty acres in size. The lotus flowers were all growing on level earth, their leaves as large as mats and their flowers like umbrellas. The fallen blossoms covered the ground beneath the stalks to the depth of a foot or more. The boy led Aduan in and said, \""Now first of all, sit down for a little while!\"" Then he went away.\n\nAfter a time, a beautiful girl thrust aside the lotus flowers and came into the open. It was Rose of Evening. They looked at each other with happy timidity, each telling how they had longed for the other and sharing stories of their former lives. They weighted the lotus leaves with stones to create a cozy retreat where they could be together and promised to meet there every evening. Then they parted. Aduan returned, and his illness left him. From that time on, he met Rose of Evening every day in the lotus field.\n\nAfter a few days, they had to accompany the Prince of the Dragon Cave to the birthday festival of the King of the Wu River. The festival came to an end, and all the dancers returned home. Only the King had kept back Rose of Evening and one of the nightingale dancers to teach the girls in his castle. Months passed, and no news came from Rose of Evening, filling Aduan with longing and despair. Mother Hia went every day to the castle of the god of the Wu River. Aduan told her that Rose of Evening was his cousin and entreated her to take him along so that he could at least see her once. She took him along and let him stay at the lodge-house of the river-god for a few days. However, the indwellers of the castle were so strictly watched that he could not see Rose of Evening even once. Sadly, Aduan went back again.\n\nAnother month passed, and filled with gloomy thoughts, Aduan wished that death might be his portion. One day, Mother Hia came to him full of pity and began to sympathize with him. \""What a shame,\"" said she, \""that Rose of Evening has cast herself into the river!\"" Aduan was extremely frightened, and his tears flowed resistlessly. He tore his beautiful garments, took his gold and pearls, and went out with the sole idea of following his beloved in death. Yet the waters of the river stood up before him like walls, and no matter how often he ran against them, head down, they always flung him back.\n\nHe did not dare return, fearing he might be questioned about his festival garments and severely punished for ruining them. So he stood there, knowing not what to do, while perspiration ran down to his ankles. Suddenly, at the foot of the water-wall, he saw a tall tree. Like a monkey, he climbed to its very top and then, with all his might, shot into the waves. Without being wet, he found himself suddenly swimming on the surface of the river. Unexpectedly, the world of men rose up once more before his dazzled eyes. He swam to the shore, and as he walked along the riverbank, his thoughts returned to his old mother. He took a ship and traveled home.\n\nWhen he reached the village, it seemed to him as though all the houses belonged to another world. The following morning, he entered his mother's house and heard a girl's voice beneath the window saying, \""Your son has come back again!\"" The voice sounded like Rose of Evening's, and when she came to greet him at his mother's side, sure enough, it was Rose of Evening herself. In that hour, the joy of these two, so fond of each other, overcame all their sorrow. However, in the mother's mind, sorrow and doubt, terror and joy mingled in constant succession in a thousand different ways.\n\nWhen Rose of Evening had been in the palace of the river-king and realized she would never see Aduan again, she determined to die and flung herself into the waters of the stream. However, she was carried to the surface, and the waves cradled her until a ship came by and took her aboard. They asked whence she came. Rose of Evening had originally been a celebrated singing girl of Wu, who had fallen into the river and whose body had never been found. So she thought to herself that she could not return to her old life again. She answered, \""Madame Dsiang, in Dschen-Giang is my mother-in-law.\"" The travelers took passage for her in a ship that brought her to the place she had mentioned. The widow Dsiang first said she must be mistaken, but the girl insisted there was no mistake and told Aduan's mother her whole story. Though charmed by her surpassing loveliness, the widow feared that Rose of Evening was too young to live a widow's life. However, the girl was respectful and industrious, and when she saw that poverty ruled in her new home, she took her pearls and sold them for a high price. Aduan's old mother was greatly pleased to see how seriously the girl took her duties.\n\nNow that Aduan had returned, Rose of Evening could not control her joy. Even Aduan's old mother cherished the hope that perhaps her son had not died after all. She secretly dug up her son's grave, yet all his bones were still lying in it. So she questioned Aduan, and for the first time, he realized that he was a departed spirit. He feared that Rose of Evening might regard him with disgust because he was no longer a human being. So he ordered his mother on no account to speak of it, and this his mother promised. She spread the report in the village that the body found in the river had not been that of her son at all. Yet she could not rid herself of the fear that, since Aduan was a departed spirit, heaven might refuse to send him a child.\n\nIn spite of her fear, however, she was able to hold a grandson in her arms in due time. When she looked at him, he was no different from other children, and her cup of joy was filled to overflowing. Rose of Evening gradually became aware that Aduan was not really a human being. \""Why did you not tell me at once?\"" she asked. \""Departed spirits who wear the garments of the dragon castle surround themselves with a soul-casing so heavy in texture that they can no longer be distinguished from the living. If one can obtain the lime made of dragon-horn which is in the castle, then the bones may be glued together in such a way that flesh and blood will grow over them again. What a pity that we could not obtain the lime while we were there!\""\n\nAduan sold his pearl, for which a merchant from foreign parts gave him an enormous sum. Thus, his family grew very wealthy. Once, on his mother's birthday, he danced with his wife and sang to please her. The news reached the castle of the Dragon Prince, who thought to carry off Rose of Evening by force. But Aduan, alarmed, went to the Prince and declared that both he and his wife were departed spirits. They examined him, and since he cast no shadow, his word was taken, and he was not robbed of Rose of Evening."""
15,The Constable,"""In a city in the neighborhood of Kaiutschou, there once lived a constable by the name of Dung. One day, after returning from a hunt for thieves, twilight had already begun to fall. Before wading through the stream that flowed through the city, he sat down on the bank, lit a pipe, and took off his shoes. As he looked up, he suddenly saw a man in a red hat, dressed as a constable, crouching beside him.\n\nAstonished, Dung inquired, \""Who are you? Your clothes indicate that you are a member of our profession, but I have never yet seen you among the men of our local force. Tell me, pray, whence you come?\"" The other answered, \""I am weary, having come a long journey, and would like to enjoy a pipeful of tobacco in your company. I am sure you will not object to that.\"" Dung handed him a pipe and tobacco, but the other constable replied, \""I do not need them. Just you keep on smoking. It is enough for me to enjoy the odor.\""\n\nThey chatted for a while and waded through the stream together. Gradually, they became quite confidential, and the stranger said, \""I will be quite frank with you. I am the head constable of the Nether World, and am subject to the Lord of the Great Mountain. You yourself are a constable of reputation here in the upper world. Because of my skill, I have standing in the world below. Since we are so well suited to each other, I should like to enter into a bond of brotherhood with you.\"" Dung was agreeable and asked, \""But what really brings you here?\""\n\nThe other replied, \""In your district, there lives a certain Wang, who was formerly superintendent of the granaries and caused the death of an officer. This man has now accused him in the Nether World. The King of the Nether World cannot come to a decision in the case, and therefore has asked the Lord of the Great Mountain to settle it. The Lord of the Great Mountain has ordered that Wang's property and life be shortened. First, his property is to be sequestered here in the upper world, and then his soul is to be dragged to the nether one. I have been sent out by the Judge of the Dead to fetch him. Yet the established custom is that when someone is sent for, the constable has first to report to the god of the city. The god of the city then issues a summons and sends one of his own spirit constables to seize the soul and deliver it over to me. Only then may I take it away with me.\"" Dung asked for further particulars, but the other merely said, \""Later on, you will see it all for yourself.\""\n\nWhen they reached the city, Dung invited his colleague to stay at his home and entertained him with wine and food. However, the other only talked and touched neither the goblet nor the chopsticks. Dung said, \""In my haste, I could not find any better meal for you. I am afraid it is not good enough.\"" But his guest replied, \""Oh no, I am already surfeited and satisfied! We spirits feed only on odors; in which respect we differ from men.\"" It was late at night before he set out to visit the temple of the city god.\n\nNo sooner did morning dawn than he reappeared to take his leave and said, \""Now all is in order: I am off! In two years' time, you will go to Taianfu, the city near the Great Mountain, and there we will meet again.\"" Dung began to feel ill at ease. A few days later, news came that Wang had died. The district mandarin journeyed to the dead man's natal village to express his sympathy, and among his followers was Dung. The inn-keeper there was a tenant of Wang's.\n\nDung asked him, \""Did anything out of the ordinary happen when Sir Wang died?\"" The inn-keeper replied, \""It was all very strange. My mother, who had been very busy in his house, came home and fell into a violent fever. She was unconscious for a day and a night and could hardly breathe. She came to on the very day when the news of Sir Wang's death was made public and said, 'I have been to the Nether World and I met him there. He had chains about his neck, and several devils were dragging him along. I asked him what he had done, but he said: \""I have no time to tell you now. When you return, ask my wife and she will tell you all!\""' And yesterday my mother went there and asked her. Wang's wife told her with tears, 'My master was an official, but for a long time he did not make any headway. He was superintendent of the granaries in Nanking, and in the same city was a high officer, with whom my master became very intimate.' \n\nHe always came to visit our house, and he and my master would talk and drink together. One day my master said to him, \""We administrative mandarins have a large salary and a good income besides. You are an officer and have even reached the second step in rank, yet your salary is so small that you cannot possibly make it do. Have you any other income aside from it?\"" The officer replied, \""We are such good friends that I know I can speak openly to you. We officers are compelled to find some additional sources of revenue in order that our pockets may not be altogether empty. When we pay our men, we make a small percentage of gains on the exchange; and we also carry more soldiers on our rosters than there actually are present. If we had to live on our salaries, we would die of hunger!\"" \n\nWhen my husband heard him say this, he could not rid himself of the idea that by disclosing these criminal proceedings, the State would be indebted to him, and that it would surely aid his plans for advancement. On the other hand, he reflected that it would not be right to abuse his friend's confidence. With these ideas in his mind, he retired to his inner rooms. In the courtyard stood a round pavilion. Lost in heavy thought, he crossed his hands behind his back and walked round and round the pavilion for a long time. Finally, he said with a sigh, \""Charity begins at home; I will sacrifice my friend!\"" Then he drew up his report, in which the officer was indicted.\n\nAn imperial order was issued, the matter was investigated, and the officer was condemned to death. My husband, however, was at once increased in rank and from that time on advanced rapidly. With the exception of myself, no one ever knew anything of the matter. When my mother told them of her encounter with Wang in the Nether World, the whole family burst into loud weeping. Four tents full of Buddhist and Taoist priests were sent for, who fasted and read masses for thirty-five days in order that Wang might be delivered. Whole mountains of paper money, silk, and straw figures were burned, and the ceremonies have not yet come to an end. When Dung heard this, he was very much frightened.\n\nTwo years later, he received an order to journey to Taianfu in order to arrest some robbers there. He thought to himself, \""My friend, the spirit, must be very powerful indeed, to have known about this trip so far in advance. I must inquire for him. Perhaps I will see him again.\"" When he reached Taianfu, he sought out an inn. The inn-keeper received him with the words, \""Are you Master Dung, and have you come from the bay of Kaiutschou?\"" \n\n\""I am the man,\"" answered Dung, alarmed, \""how do you happen to know me?\"" The inn-keeper replied, \""The constable of the temple of the Great Mountain appeared to me last night and said: 'To-morrow a man by the name of Dung, who is a good friend of mine, is coming from the bay of Kaiutschou!' And then he described your appearance and your clothes to me exactly, and told me to make careful note of them, and when you came to treat you with the greatest consideration, and to take no pay from you, since he would repay me lavishly. So when I saw you coming, everything was exactly as my dreams had foretold, and I knew you at once. I have already prepared a quiet room for you, and beg that you will condescend to make yourself at ease.\""\n\nJoyfully, Dung followed him, and the inn-keeper waited on him with the greatest consideration, ensuring he had plenty to eat and drink. At midnight, the spirit arrived. Without having opened the door, he stood by Dung's bedside, gave him his hand, and asked how things had gone with him since he had last seen him. Dung answered all his questions and thanked him for appearing to the inn-keeper in a dream.\n\nHe continued to live for some days at the inn. During the day, he walked on the Great Mountain, and at night, his friend came to visit him and talked with him, asking what had happened to Sir Wang. \""His sentence has already been spoken,\"" answered the other. \""This man pretended to be conscientious and traitorously brought about the death of his friend. Of all sins, there is no greater sin than this. As a punishment, he will be sent forth again into the world as an animal.\"" Then he added, \""When you reach home, you must take constant care of your health. Fate has allowed you seventy-eight years of mortal life. When your time is up, I will come to fetch you myself. Then I will see that you obtain a place as constable in the Nether World, where we can always be together.\"" When he had said this, he disappeared."""
16,The Dangerous Reward,"""The Dangerous Reward\n\nOnce upon a time, a man named Hu-Wu-Bau, who lived near the Great Mountain, went walking there one day. Under a tree, he met a messenger in a red robe who called out to him, \""The Lord of the Great Mountain would like to see you!\"" The man was frightened but dared not object. The messenger instructed him to shut his eyes, and when he was allowed to open them again after a short time, he found himself standing before a lofty palace. He entered to see the god, who had a meal prepared for him and explained, \""I only sent for you today because I heard you intended to travel to the West. In that case, I would like to give you a letter to take to my daughter.\""\n\n\""But where is your daughter?\"" asked Hu-Wu-Bau.\n\n\""She is married to the river-god,\"" was the reply. \""All you need to do is take along the letter lying there. When you reach the middle of the Yellow River, beat against the side of the ship and call out: 'Greencoat!' Then someone will appear and take the letter from you.\"" With these words, he handed Hu-Wu-Bau the letter, and he was taken back to the upper world.\n\nWhen Hu-Wu-Bau arrived at the Yellow River on his journey, he followed the Lord of the Great Mountain's instructions and cried, \""Greencoat!\"" Sure enough, a girl in green garments rose from the water, took him by the hand, and told him to close his eyes. She led him into the palace of the river-god, where he delivered the letter. The river-god entertained him splendidly and expressed his gratitude. At parting, he said, \""I am grateful that you have made this long journey to see me. I have nothing to give you, however, save this pair of green silk shoes. While you are wearing them, you can keep on walking as long as you like and never grow weary. They will also grant you second sight, allowing you to see the spirits and gods.\""\n\nThanking the river-god for the gift, Hu-Wu-Bau returned to his ship and continued his journey to the West. After a year had passed, he came back again. When he reached the Great Mountain, he thought it would be proper to report to the god. He knocked against the tree and gave his name. In a moment, the red-clad messenger appeared and led him to the Lord of the Mountain. Hu-Wu-Bau reported that he had delivered the letter to the river-god and described how things were there. The Lord of the Mountain thanked him.\n\nDuring the meal prepared for him, Hu-Wu-Bau withdrew to a quiet spot and suddenly saw his deceased father, bound and loaded with chains, laboring alongside several hundred other criminals. Moved to tears, he asked, \""O my father, why are you here?\""\n\nHis father replied, \""During my life on earth, I happened to tread on bread, hence I was condemned to hard labor at this spot. I have passed two years in this manner, yet their bitterness has been unspeakable. Since you are acquainted with the Lord of the Mountain, you might plead for me and beg him to excuse me from this task and make me the field-god in our village.\""\n\nHis son promised to do so and returned to plead with the Lord of the Mountain. The god seemed inclined to listen but warned, \""The quick and the dead tread different paths. It is not well for the dead and the living to abide near one another permanently.\""\n\nHu-Wu-Bau returned home, but in about a year's time, nearly all his children had died. In the terror of his heart, he turned to the Lord of the Great Mountain. He beat on the tree, and the red-coat came to lead him into the palace. There, he told of his misfortune and begged the god to protect him. The Lord of the Mountain smiled and reminded him, \""Did I not tell you in the start that the quick and the dead tread different paths, and that it is not well if they abide near each other permanently? Now you see what has happened!\"" Yet, he sent his messenger to fetch Hu-Wu-Bau's father.\n\nWhen the father arrived, the god spoke to him, \""I forgave you your offense and sent you back to your home as a field-god. It was your duty to bring happiness to your family. Instead, nearly all of your grandchildren have died. Why is this?\""\n\nThe father explained, \""I had been away from home so long that I was overjoyed to return. Besides, I had meat and drink in overflowing measure. So I thought of my little grandchildren and called them to me.\""\n\nThe Lord of the Great Mountain appointed another field-god for that village and gave the father another place. From that time on, no further misfortune befell the family of Hu-Wu-Bau."""
17,The Disowned Princess,"""At the time that the Tang dynasty was reigning, there lived a man named Liu I, who had failed to pass his examinations for the doctorate. Disheartened, he traveled home again. He had gone six or seven miles when a bird flew up in a field, startling his horse, which shied and ran ten miles before he could stop him. Eventually, he came across a woman herding sheep on a hillside. She was lovely to look upon, yet her face bore traces of hidden grief. Astonished, Liu I asked her what was the matter.\n\nThe woman began to sob and said, \""Fortune has forsaken me, and I am in need and ashamed. Since you are kind enough to ask, I will tell you all. I am the youngest daughter of the Dragon-King of the Sea of Dungting, and I was married to the second son of the Dragon-King of Ging Dschou. Yet my husband ill-treated and disowned me. I complained to my step-parents, but they loved their son blindly and did nothing. When I grew insistent, they both became angry, and I was sent out here to herd sheep.\"" After sharing her plight, she burst into tears, losing all control of herself. She continued, \""The Sea of Dungting is far from here; yet I know that you will have to pass it on your homeward journey. I should like to give you a letter to my father, but I do not know whether you would take it.\""\n\nLiu I answered, \""Your words have moved my heart. Would that I had wings and could fly away with you. I will be glad to deliver the letter to your father. Yet the Sea of Dungting is long and broad, and how am I to find him?\"" \n\n\""On the southern shore of the Sea stands an orange-tree,\"" the woman replied, \""which people call the tree of sacrifice. When you get there, you must loosen your girdle and strike the tree with it three times in succession. Then someone will appear whom you must follow. When you see my father, tell him in what need you found me, and that I long greatly for his help.\"" She then fetched a letter from her breast and handed it to Liu I. She bowed to him, looked toward the east, and sighed, unexpectedly causing tears to roll from Liu I's eyes as well. He took the letter and thrust it into his bag.\n\nCurious, Liu I asked, \""I cannot understand why you have to herd sheep. Do the gods slaughter cattle like men?\"" \n\n\""These are not ordinary sheep,\"" the woman answered. \""These are rain-sheep.\"" \n\n\""But what are rain-sheep?\"" he inquired. \n\n\""They are the thunder-rams,\"" she replied. \n\nUpon closer inspection, Liu I noticed that these sheep walked around in a proud, savage fashion, quite different from ordinary sheep. He added, \""But if I deliver the letter for you, and you succeed in getting back to the Sea of Dungting in safety, then you must not use me like a stranger.\"" \n\nThe woman answered, \""How could I use you as a stranger? You shall be my dearest friend.\"" With these words, they parted.\n\nIn the course of a month, Liu I reached the Sea of Dungting, asked for the orange-tree, and, sure enough, found it. He loosened his girdle and struck the tree with it three times. At once, a warrior emerged from the waves of the sea and asked, \""Whence come you, honored guest?\"" \n\nLiu I replied, \""I have come on an important mission and want to see the King.\"" \n\nThe warrior gestured toward the water, and the waves turned into a solid street along which he led Liu I. The dragon-castle rose before them with its thousand gates, and magic flowers and rare grasses bloomed in luxurious profusion. The warrior bade him wait at the side of a great hall.\n\nLiu I asked, \""What is this place called?\"" \n\n\""It is the Hall of the Spirits,\"" was the reply. \n\nLiu I looked around; all the jewels known to earth were there in abundance. The columns were of white quartz, inlaid with green jade; the seats were made of coral, the curtains of mountain crystal as clear as water, and the windows of burnished glass adorned with rich lattice-work. The beams of the ceiling, ornamented with amber, rose in wide arches. An exotic fragrance filled the hall, whose outlines were lost in darkness.\n\nLiu I waited a long time for the king. To all his questions, the warrior replied, \""Our master is pleased at this moment to talk with the priest of the sun up on the coral-tower about the sacred book of the fire. He will, no doubt, soon be through.\"" \n\nLiu I asked, \""Why is he interested in the sacred book of the fire?\"" \n\nThe reply was, \""Our master is a dragon. The dragons are powerful through the power of water. They can cover hill and dale with a single wave. The priest is a human being. Human beings are powerful through fire. They can burn the greatest palaces by means of a torch. Fire and water fight each other, being different in their nature. For that reason, our master is now talking with the priest, in order to find a way in which fire and water may complete each other.\""\n\nBefore they had quite finished, a man in a purple robe appeared, bearing a scepter of jade in his hand. \n\nThe warrior said, \""This is my master!\"" \n\nLiu I bowed before him. \n\nThe king asked, \""Are you not a living human being? What has brought you here?\"" \n\nLiu I gave his name and explained, \""I have been to the capital and there failed to pass my examination. When I was passing by the Ging Dschou River, I saw your daughter, whom you love, herding sheep in the wilderness. The winds tousled her hair, and the rain drenched her. I could not bear to see her trouble and spoke to her. She complained that her husband had cast her out and wept bitterly. Then she gave me a letter for you. And that is why I have come to visit you, O King!\"" \n\nWith these words, he fetched out the letter and handed it to the king. When the latter had read it, he hid his face in his sleeve and said with a sigh, \""It is my own fault. I picked out a worthless husband for her. Instead of securing her happiness, I have brought her to shame in a distant land. You are a stranger, and yet you have been willing to help her in her distress, for which I am very grateful to you.\"" Then he began to sob again, and all those around him shed tears. The monarch gave the letter to a servant, who took it into the interior of the palace; soon, the sound of loud lamentations rose from the inner rooms.\n\nThe king was alarmed and turned to an official, saying, \""Go and tell them within not to weep so loudly! I am afraid that Tsian Tang may hear them.\"" \n\n\""Who is Tsian Tang?\"" asked Liu I. \n\n\""He is my beloved brother,\"" answered the king. \""Formerly he was the ruler of the Tsian-Tang River, but now he has been deposed.\"" \n\nLiu I asked, \""Why should the matter be kept from him?\"" \n\n\""He is so wild and uncontrollable,\"" was the reply, \""that I fear he would cause great damage. The deluge which covered the earth for nine long years in the time of the Emperor Yau was the work of his anger. Because he fell out with one of the kings of heaven, he caused a great deluge that rose and covered the tops of five high mountains. Then the king of heaven grew angry with him and gave him to me to guard. I had to chain him to a column in my palace.\""\n\nBefore he had finished speaking, a tremendous turmoil arose, splitting the skies and making the earth tremble, so that the whole palace began to rock. Smoke and clouds rose hissing and puffing. A red dragon, a thousand feet long, with flashing eyes, a blood-red tongue, scarlet scales, and a fiery beard came surging up. He was dragging along through the air the column to which he had been bound, together with its chain. Thunders and lightnings roared and darted around his body; sleet and snow, rain and hail-stones whirled about him in confusion. There was a crash of thunder, and he flew up to the skies and disappeared.\n\nLiu I fell to earth in terror. The king helped him up with his own hand and said, \""Do not be afraid! That is my brother, who is hastening to Ging Dschou in his rage. We will soon have good news!\"" \n\nThen he had food and drink brought in for his guest. When the goblet had thrice made the rounds, a gentle breeze began to murmur, and a fine rain fell. A youth clad in a purple gown and wearing a lofty hat entered, a sword hanging at his side. His appearance was manly and heroic. Behind him walked a girl radiantly beautiful, wearing a robe of misty fragrance. When Liu I looked at her, lo, it was the dragon-princess whom he had met on his way! A throng of maidens in rosy garments received her, laughing and giggling, and led her into the interior of the palace. The king, however, presented Liu I to the youth and said, \""This is Tsian Tang, my brother!\""\n\nTsian Tang thanked him for having brought the message. Then he turned to his brother and said, \""I have fought against the accursed dragons and have utterly defeated them!\"" \n\n\""How many did you slay?\"" \n\n\""Six hundred thousand.\"" \n\n\""Were any fields damaged?\"" \n\n\""The fields were damaged for eight hundred miles around.\"" \n\n\""And where is the heartless husband?\"" \n\n\""I ate him alive!\"" \n\nThe king was alarmed and said, \""What the fickle boy did was not to be endured, it is true. But still, you were a little too rough with him; in future, you must not do anything of the sort again.\"" Tsian Tang promised not to.\n\nThat evening, Liu I was feasted at the castle. Music and dancing lent charm to the banquet. A thousand warriors with banners and spears stood at attention. Trombones and trumpets resounded, and drums and kettledrums thundered and rattled as the warriors danced a war-dance. The music expressed how Tsian Tang had broken through the ranks of the enemy, and the hair of the guest who listened to it rose on his head in terror. Then, again, there was heard the music of strings, flutes, and little golden bells. A thousand maidens in crimson and green silk danced around. The return of the princess was also told in tones. The music sounded like a song of sadness and plaining, and all who heard it were moved to tears. The King of the Sea of Dungting was filled with joy.\n\nHe raised his goblet and drank to the health of his guest, and all sorrow departed from them. Both rulers thanked Liu I in verses, and Liu I answered them in a rimed toast. The crowd of courtiers in the palace-hall applauded. Then the King of the Sea of Dungting drew forth a blue cloud-casket in which was the horn of a rhinoceros, which divides the water. Tsian Tang brought out a platter of red amber on which lay a carbuncle. These they presented to their guest, and the other inmates of the palace also heaped up embroideries, brocades, and pearls by his side. Surrounded by shimmer and light, Liu I sat there, smiling, and bowed his thanks to all sides. When the banquet was ended, he slept in the Palace of Frozen Radiance.\n\nOn the following day, another banquet was held. Tsian Tang, who was not quite himself, sat carelessly on his seat and said, \""The Princess of the Dungting Sea is handsome and delicately fashioned. She has had the misfortune to be disowned by her husband, and today her marriage is annulled. I should like to find another husband for her. If you were agreeable, it would be to your advantage. But if you were not willing to marry her, you may go your way, and should we ever meet again, we will not know each other.\""\n\nLiu I was angered by the careless way in which Tsian Tang spoke to him. The blood rose to his head, and he replied, \""I served as a messenger because I felt sorry for the princess, but not in order to gain an advantage for myself. To kill a husband and carry off a wife is something an honest man does not do. And since I am only an ordinary man, I prefer to die rather than do as you say.\""\n\nTsian Tang rose, apologized, and said, \""My words were over-hasty. I hope you will not take them ill!\"" The King of the Dungting Sea also spoke kindly to him and censured Tsian Tang because of his rude speech. So there was no more said about marriage.\n\nOn the following day, Liu I took his leave, and the Queen of the Dungting Sea gave a farewell banquet in his honor. With tears, the queen said to Liu I, \""My daughter owes you a great debt of gratitude, and we have not had an opportunity to make it up to you. Now you are going away, and we see you go with heavy hearts!\"" \n\nThen she ordered the princess to thank Liu I. The princess stood there, blushing, bowed to him, and said, \""We will probably never see each other again!\"" Then tears choked her voice.\n\nIt is true that Liu I had resisted the stormy urging of her uncle, but when he saw the princess standing before him in all the charm of her loveliness, he felt sad at heart; yet he controlled himself and went his way. The treasures he took with him were incalculable. The king and his brother themselves escorted him as far as the river.\n\nWhen, on his return home, he sold no more than a hundredth part of what he had received, his fortune already ran into the millions, and he was wealthier than all his neighbors. He decided to take a wife and heard of a widow who lived in the North with her daughter. Her father had become a Taoist in his later years and had vanished in the clouds without ever returning. The mother lived in poverty with the daughter; yet since the girl was beautiful beyond measure, she was seeking a distinguished husband for her.\n\nLiu I was content to take her, and the day of the wedding was set. When he saw his bride unveiled on the evening of her wedding day, she looked just like the dragon-princess. He asked her about it, but she merely smiled and said nothing.\n\nAfter a time, heaven sent them a son. Then she told her husband, \""Today I will confess to you that I am truly the Princess of Dungting Sea. When you had rejected my uncle's proposal and gone away, I fell ill of longing and was near death. My parents wanted to send for you, but they feared you might take exception to my family. And so it was that I married you disguised as a human maiden. I had not ventured to tell you until now, but since heaven has sent us a son, I hope that you will love his mother as well.\""\n\nThen Liu I awoke as though from a deep sleep, and from that time on, both were very fond of each other. One day, his wife said, \""If you wish to stay with me eternally, then we cannot continue to dwell in the world of men. We dragons live ten thousand years, and you shall share our longevity. Come back with me to the Sea of Dungting!\""\n\nTen years passed, and no one knew where Liu I, who had disappeared, might be. Then, by accident, a relative went sailing across the Sea of Dungting. Suddenly, a blue mountain rose up out of the water. The seamen cried in alarm, \""There is no mountain on this spot! It must be a water-demon!\"" \n\nWhile they were still pointing to it and talking, the mountain drew near the ship, and a gaily-colored boat slid from its summit into the water. A man sat in the middle, and fairies stood at either side of him. The man was Liu I. He beckoned to his cousin, and the latter drew up his garments and stepped into the boat with him. But when he had entered the boat, it turned into a mountain. On the mountain stood a splendid castle, and in the castle stood Liu I, surrounded with radiance, with the music of stringed instruments floating about him.\n\nThey greeted each other, and Liu I said to his cousin, \""We have been parted no more than a moment, and your hair is already gray!\"" \n\nHis cousin answered, \""You are a god and blessed: I have only a mortal body. Thus fate has decreed.\"" \n\nThen Liu I gave him fifty pills and said, \""Each pill will extend your life for the space of a year. When you have lived the tale of these years, come to me and dwell no longer in the earthly world of dust, where there is nothing but toil and trouble.\""\n\nThen he took him back across the sea and disappeared. His cousin, however, retired from the world, and fifty years later, when he had taken all the pills, he disappeared and was never seen again."""
18,The Favorite Of Fortune And The Child Of Ill Luck,"""Once upon a time, there was a proud prince who had a daughter. However, the daughter was a child of ill luck. When it came time for her to marry, she summoned all her suitors to assemble before her father's palace. The princess planned to throw down a ball of red silk among them, and whoever caught it would become her husband. Many princes and counts gathered before the castle, but among them was also a beggar. The princess noticed dragons crawling into his ears and out of his nostrils, for he was a child of luck. When she threw the ball, the beggar caught it.\n\nHer father was furious and asked, \""Why did you throw the ball into the beggar's hands?\"" The princess replied, \""He is a favorite of Fortune. I will marry him, and then, perhaps, I will share in his good luck.\"" The king would not hear of it, and in his rage, he drove her from the castle. Thus, the princess had to leave with the beggar. They lived in a small hut, where she had to hunt for herbs and roots and cook them herself, often going hungry.\n\nOne day, her husband said, \""I will set out and seek my fortune. When I have found it, I will come back and fetch you.\"" The princess agreed, and he left, being gone for eighteen years. During this time, the princess lived in want and affliction, as her father remained hard and merciless. If her mother had not secretly provided her with food and money, she would have surely starved.\n\nMeanwhile, the beggar found his fortune and eventually became an emperor. He returned and stood before his wife, but she no longer recognized him; she only saw a powerful emperor. He asked her how she was getting along. She replied, \""Why do you ask me how I am getting along? I am too far beneath your notice.\"" Curious, he inquired about her husband. She explained, \""My husband was a beggar. He went away to seek his fortune eighteen years ago, and he has not yet returned.\""\n\nThe emperor asked, \""What have you done during all those long years?\"" She answered, \""I have been waiting for him to return.\"" When the emperor saw her unwavering faithfulness, he revealed his true identity. He had her clothed in magnificent garments and took her with him to his imperial palace, where they lived in splendor and happiness.\n\nAfter a few days, the emperor said to his wife, \""We spend every day in festivities, as though every day were New Year.\"" She responded, \""And why should we not celebrate, since we have now become emperor and empress?\"" Yet, despite her newfound status, she remained a child of ill luck. Tragically, after only eighteen days as empress, she fell sick and died. The emperor, however, lived for many long years, carrying the memory of his beloved wife with him."""
20,Ali Baba And Forty Thieves,"""The story takes place in Baghdad during the Abbasid era, where Ali Baba and his elder brother Cassim are the sons of a merchant. After the death of their father, the greedy Cassim marries a wealthy woman and becomes well-to-do, building on their father's business. In contrast, Ali Baba marries a poor woman and settles into the trade of a woodcutter, living a modest life.\n\nOne day, while collecting and cutting firewood in the forest, Ali Baba overhears a group of forty thieves visiting their treasure store. The treasure is hidden in a cave, the entrance of which is sealed by magic. It opens with the words \""Open, Simsim,\"" and seals itself with \""Close, Simsim.\"" After the thieves leave, Ali Baba enters the cave and takes some of the treasure home, unaware of the danger that lies ahead.\n\nAli Baba borrows his sister-in-law's scales to weigh his newfound wealth of gold coins. Unbeknownst to him, she secretly places a blob of wax in the scales to discover what he is measuring. To her shock, she finds a gold coin sticking to the scales and tells her husband, the greedy Cassim. Under pressure from Cassim, Ali Baba reveals the secret of the cave. Cassim, driven by greed, goes to the cave but forgets the magic words to exit, leading to his demise at the hands of the thieves who find him there.\n\nWhen Cassim does not return, Ali Baba goes to the cave to search for him and discovers his brother's body, gruesomely displayed to deter others. Ali Baba brings the body home and entrusts Morgiana, a clever slave-girl in Cassim's household, with the task of making it appear that Cassim died a natural death. Morgiana cleverly purchases medicines and hires an old tailor, Baba Mustafa, to stitch Cassim's body back together, allowing the family to give him a proper burial without raising suspicion.\n\nThe thieves soon realize that someone else knows their secret and set out to find Ali Baba. One of the thieves encounters Baba Mustafa, who reveals that he has sewn a dead man's body. The thief asks the tailor to lead him to the house where the deed was done, marking the door with a symbol for the other thieves to follow. However, Morgiana, loyal to her master, foils the plan by marking all the houses in the neighborhood with a similar symbol, causing confusion among the thieves.\n\nWhen the forty thieves return that night, they cannot identify the correct house, leading to the head thief killing the lesser thief in frustration. The next day, another thief attempts to find Ali Baba's house but fails again, resulting in his death for his foolishness. Finally, the chief thief decides to investigate himself, memorizing every detail of Ali Baba's home.\n\nDisguised as an oil merchant, the chief of the thieves seeks Ali Baba's hospitality, bringing with him forty thieves hidden in oil jars. Once Ali Baba is asleep, they plan to kill him. However, Morgiana discovers their plot and pours boiling oil on the thieves, killing them all. When the chief thief realizes his men are dead, he escapes, vowing revenge.\n\nIn time, the chief thief establishes himself as a merchant and befriends Ali Baba's son, who now runs Cassim's business. Invited to dinner at Ali Baba's house, the thief is recognized by Morgiana. She performs a dance with a dagger and plunges it into the heart of the thief when he is off guard. Initially angry with Morgiana, Ali Baba learns of her bravery and the threat she eliminated. Grateful, he grants her freedom and marries her to his son.\n\nThus, Ali Baba is left as the only one who knows the secret of the treasure in the cave and how to access it. The story concludes happily for Ali Baba, his family, and Morgiana, while the forty thieves and Cassim meet their unfortunate ends."""
21,Enchanted Wreath,"""Once upon a time, there lived near a forest a man and his wife, along with two girls. One girl was the daughter of the man, and the other was the daughter of his wife. The man's daughter was good and beautiful, while the woman's daughter was cross and ugly. However, her mother was oblivious to this and thought her daughter the most enchanting maiden ever seen.\n\nOne day, the man called to his daughter and asked her to accompany him into the forest to cut wood. They worked hard all day, but despite their efforts, they were very cold due to the heavy rain. When they returned home, they were soaked through. To his dismay, the man realized he had left his axe behind. Knowing it would become rusty if left in the mud overnight, he asked his wife, \""I have dropped my axe in the forest; bid your daughter go and fetch it, for mine has worked hard all day and is both wet and weary.\"" \n\nThe wife, however, replied, \""If your daughter is wet already, it is all the more reason that she should go and get the axe. Besides, she is a strong girl, and a little rain will not hurt her, while my daughter would be sure to catch a bad cold.\"" The man, knowing there was no point in arguing, sighed and told his daughter she must return to the forest for the axe.\n\nThe walk took some time as it was dark, and her shoes often stuck in the mud. Nevertheless, she was brave and never thought of turning back. After enduring the difficult path, she finally reached the spot where she and her father had been cutting wood and found the axe. To her surprise, three little doves were sitting on the handle, looking very sad. \""You poor little things,\"" she said, stroking them. \""Why do you sit there and get wet? Go and fly home to your nest; it will be much warmer than this. But first, eat this bread I saved from my dinner, and perhaps you will feel happier.\"" She crumbled the bread on the ground, and the doves fluttered cheerfully towards it.\n\n\""Good-bye,\"" she said, picking up the axe and heading home. By the time the doves finished the crumbs, they felt much better and flew back to their nest in the tree. \""That is a good girl,\"" said one dove. \""I was too weak to stretch out a wing before she came. I would like to do something to show my gratitude.\"" The second dove suggested, \""Let us give her a wreath of flowers that will never fade as long as she wears it.\"" The third dove added, \""And let the tiniest singing birds in the world sit amongst the flowers.\"" They agreed, and when the girl stepped into her cottage, a wreath of rosebuds adorned her head, and a crowd of little birds sang unseen.\n\nThe father, sitting by the fire, thought that despite her muddy clothes, he had never seen his daughter looking so lovely. However, the stepmother and her daughter grew wild with envy. \""How absurd to walk about on such a pouring night, dressed up like that,\"" the stepmother remarked crossly, roughly pulling off the wreath to place it on her own daughter. As she did so, the roses withered and turned brown, and the birds flew out of the window. \""See what a trumpery thing it is!\"" cried the stepmother. \""Now take your supper and go to bed, for it is near upon midnight.\"" Though she pretended to despise the wreath, she longed for her daughter to have one like it.\n\nThe next evening, the father returned from the forest without his axe again. The stepmother was glad and said, \""You have forgotten your axe again, you careless man! But now your daughter shall stay at home, and mine shall go and bring it back.\"" She threw a cloak over her daughter's shoulders and sent her off to the forest. The girl set forth with a bad attitude, grumbling to herself, for she wished for the wreath but did not want the trouble of getting it.\n\nWhen she reached the spot where her stepfather had been cutting wood, she found the three little doves sitting on the handle of the axe. \""You dirty creatures,\"" she cried. \""Get away at once, or I will throw stones at you!\"" The doves, frightened, flew up to the top of a tree, shaking with anger. \""What shall we do to take revenge on her?\"" asked the smallest dove. \""We were never treated like that before.\"" The biggest dove replied, \""We must find a way to pay her back in her own coin!\"" The middle dove suggested, \""She shall never be able to say anything but 'dirty creatures' for the rest of her life.\"" The others agreed, and they made such a noise that they woke all the birds in the trees nearby.\n\nMeanwhile, the girl returned home in a foul mood. As soon as her mother heard her lift the latch of the door, she ran out to hear her adventures. \""Well, did you get the wreath?\"" she asked eagerly. \""Dirty creatures!\"" answered her daughter. \""Don't speak to me like that! What do you mean?\"" the mother asked again. \""Dirty creatures!\"" repeated the daughter, and nothing else could she say. The mother, realizing something evil had befallen her daughter, turned in rage to her stepdaughter. \""You are at the bottom of this, I know,\"" she cried. With the father out of the way, she took a stick and beat the girl until she screamed with pain and went to bed sobbing.\n\nIf the poor girl's life had been miserable before, it was ten times worse now. The moment her father's back was turned, the others teased and tormented her from morning till night, their fury increased by the sight of her wreath, which the doves had placed back on her head. This continued for several weeks until one day, as the king's son rode through the forest, he heard strange birds singing more sweetly than any he had ever heard. He tied his horse to a tree and followed the sound, discovering a beautiful girl chopping wood, adorned with a wreath of pink rosebuds from which the singing emanated. He watched her for a long time before approaching her.\n\n\""Fair maiden, who are you, and who gave you that wreath of singing roses?\"" he asked, enchanted by her beauty. \""I live in a hut on the edge of the forest,\"" she replied, blushing. \""As for the wreath, I know not how it came there, unless it was a gift from some doves I fed when they were starving!\"" The prince was delighted by her answer, which revealed her kind heart, and he fell in love with her beauty, insisting she promise to return with him to the palace as his bride. The old king was disappointed by his son's choice, wishing him to marry a neighboring princess, but since the prince had always followed his own desires, nothing was said, and a splendid wedding feast was prepared.\n\nThe day after her marriage, the bride sent a messenger with handsome presents to her father, informing him of her good fortune. The stepmother and her daughter, filled with envy, grew ill and had to take to their beds, and no one would have been sorry if they had never gotten up again. However, they eventually began to feel better, and the mother devised a plan for revenge against the girl who had never harmed her. She decided to visit an old witch in her former town, known for her magical skills, and begged her to create a mask resembling her stepdaughter. Once she had the mask, the rest would be easy. She shared her plan with her daughter, who, despite only being able to say \""dirty creatures,\"" nodded and smiled in agreement.\n\nEverything unfolded as the woman had hoped. With the help of her magic mirror, the witch saw the new princess walking in her gardens in a green silk dress and quickly produced a mask that closely resembled her. The witch advised the woman that when her daughter first wore it, she should pretend to have a toothache and cover her head with a lace veil. The woman thanked her, paid her well, and returned home with the mask hidden under her cloak.\n\nA few days later, news of a great hunt reached the palace, and the prince would leave early in the morning, leaving his wife alone all day. This was the opportunity the stepmother had been waiting for. Taking her daughter with her, she went to the palace, where she had never been before. The princess, too happy in her new home to remember her past suffering, welcomed them both and offered them beautiful gifts to take back. Eventually, she took them to the shore to see a pleasure boat made for her by her husband. Seizing her chance, the woman stealthily pushed the girl off the rock into the deep water, where she sank instantly. Then, she fastened the mask on her daughter, draped a velvet cloak over her shoulders, and arranged a lace veil over her head.\n\n\""Rest your cheek on your hand as if you are in pain when the prince returns,\"" the mother instructed. \""And be careful not to speak, whatever you do. I will go back to the witch and see if she can remove the spell laid on you by those horrible birds. Ah! Why did I not think of this before!\"" \n\nAs soon as the prince entered the palace, he rushed to his wife's chambers, finding her lying on the sofa, apparently in great pain. \""My dearest wife, what is the matter with you?\"" he cried, kneeling beside her and trying to take her hand. She snatched it away, pointing to her cheek and murmuring something he could not catch. \""What is it? Tell me! Is the pain bad? When did it begin? Shall I send for your ladies to bathe the place?\"" he asked, pouring out questions. The girl only shook her head.\n\n\""But I can't leave you like this,\"" he insisted, starting to rise. \""I must summon all the court physicians to apply soothing balms to the sore place!\"" As he spoke, he sprang to his feet to find them, but as he came near her, the girl, forgetting her mother's advice, cried out, \""Dirty creatures!\"" The young man stopped, unable to believe his ears, but assumed that pain had made the princess cross. He guessed she wished to be left alone, so he said, \""Well, I dare say a little sleep will do you good, and you will wake up better tomorrow.\""\n\nThat night was hot and airless, and after trying to rest in vain, the prince got up and went to the window. Suddenly, he saw a figure in the moonlight resembling his wife, rising from the sea and stepping onto the sands, holding out her arms towards the palace. \""That maiden is strangely like my wife,\"" he thought. \""I must see her closer!\"" He hurried down to the water, but when he arrived, the princess had vanished completely, leaving him to wonder if his eyes had deceived him.\n\nThe next morning, he visited the false bride's room, but her ladies informed him she would neither speak nor get up, though she ate everything they set before her. The prince was perplexed, unable to guess that she was waiting for her mother to return and remove the spell the doves had laid upon her. Meanwhile, she was afraid to speak, fearing she would betray herself. Eventually, he decided to summon all the court physicians, not telling her what he intended to do, lest it make her worse. He went to the four learned leeches attached to the king's court and led them to the princess's chambers. Unfortunately, upon seeing them, the princess was so enraged that she forgot about the doves and shrieked, \""Dirty creatures! Dirty creatures!\"" This so offended the physicians that they left the room at once, and nothing the prince could say would persuade them to return. He then tried to convince his wife to send them a message of apology, but she remained silent.\n\nLater that evening, after fulfilling his royal duties, the young man leaned out of his window, enjoying the cool breezes from the sea. His thoughts returned to the morning's events, and he began to wonder if he had made a mistake in marrying a low-born wife, no matter how beautiful she was. How could he have imagined that the gentle girl who had charmed him during their early days of marriage could suddenly become a rude, sulky woman? He realized that if she did not change her behavior soon, he would have to send her away from court.\n\nAs he pondered these thoughts, he noticed the figure from before standing in the water, holding out her arms towards his window. \""Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me!\"" he cried, not even realizing he was speaking. But when he reached the shore, there was nothing but shadows cast by the moonlight.\n\nA state ceremony in a distant city caused the prince to leave at daybreak, and he departed without seeing his wife again. \""Perhaps she may have come to her senses by tomorrow,\"" he thought. \""And if I am going to send her back to her father, it might be better if we do not meet in the meantime.\"" He pushed the matter from his mind and focused on his duties.\n\nIt was nearly midnight when he returned to the palace, but instead of entering, he went down to the shore and hid behind a rock. He had scarcely settled in when the girl emerged from the sea, stretching out her arms towards his window. In an instant, the prince seized her hand, but she struggled to return to the water, for she too had been under a spell. \""You are my own wife, and I shall never let you go,\"" he declared. However, as soon as he spoke, he found himself holding a hare by the paw. The hare transformed into a fish, then into a bird, and finally into a slimy, wriggling snake. The prince nearly released it, but with a strong effort, he kept his grip and drew his sword, cutting off its head. At that moment, the spell was broken, and the girl stood before him as he had first seen her, the wreath upon her head and the birds singing joyfully.\n\nThe very next morning, the stepmother arrived at the palace with an ointment the old witch had given her to place on her daughter's tongue, claiming it would break the dove's spell if the rightful bride had truly drowned. If not, it would be useless. The mother assured her that she had seen her stepdaughter sink and that there was no fear of her returning. To ensure safety, the old woman might bewitch the girl, and so she did. Afterward, the wicked stepmother traveled all night to reach the palace as quickly as possible, making her way straight to her daughter's room.\n\n\""I have got it! I have got it!\"" she cried triumphantly, applying the ointment to her daughter's tongue. \""Now what do you say?\"" she asked proudly. \""Dirty creatures! Dirty creatures!\"" answered the daughter. The mother wrung her hands and wept, realizing that all her plans had failed.\n\nAt that moment, the prince entered with his real wife. \""You both deserve death,\"" he said. \""If it were up to me, you would have it. But the princess has begged me to spare your lives, so you will be put into a ship and carried off to a desert island, where you will stay until you die.\"" \n\nThe ship was prepared, and the wicked woman and her daughter were placed aboard. It sailed away, and no more was heard of them. Meanwhile, the prince and his wife lived together long and happily, ruling their people well."""
23,Twelve Brothers,"""Once upon a time, there was a King and a Queen who lived happily together and had twelve children, all of whom were boys. One day, the King expressed a dark wish to his wife: if their thirteenth child were a girl, all her twelve brothers must die so that she could inherit the kingdom alone. To prepare for this grim fate, he ordered twelve coffins to be made, filled with shavings, and placed a little pillow in each. He locked them away in an empty room, giving the key to his wife and instructing her to keep it a secret.\n\nThe Queen was heartbroken over the fate of her sons and could not be comforted. Her youngest son, Benjamin, who was always by her side, noticed her sadness and asked her the reason. After much insistence, she revealed the existence of the coffins and their intended purpose. Benjamin comforted her, assuring her that they would find a way to escape. The Queen instructed her sons to flee into the woods and keep watch over the castle. If she bore a son, she would wave a white flag; if a daughter, a red flag, warning them to flee.\n\nThe brothers followed their mother\u2019s advice and found a tall oak tree to keep watch. On the twelfth day, Benjamin saw a blood-red flag waving from the castle, signaling their doom. Angered by the thought of suffering for a girl, the brothers vowed vengeance against all females. They ventured deeper into the woods and discovered an enchanted house, where they decided to live. Benjamin, being the youngest, stayed behind to manage the household while his brothers hunted for food.\n\nAs the years passed, their little sister grew up, kind-hearted and beautiful, with a gold star on her forehead. One day, while looking out from her window, she saw twelve shirts hanging to dry and asked her mother about them. The Queen, filled with sorrow, revealed that they belonged to her twelve brothers, who had disappeared before she was born. Determined to find them, the girl took the shirts and ventured into the woods.\n\nAfter a long journey, she arrived at the enchanted house and met Benjamin, who recognized her immediately. They rejoiced at their reunion, but Benjamin reminded her of their vow to kill any girl they encountered. The sister offered to sacrifice herself to restore her brothers, but Benjamin assured her that she need not do so. He instructed her to hide under a tub until their brothers returned.\n\nWhen the brothers came home, Benjamin revealed their sister's presence, and they were instantly captivated by her beauty. They decided she would stay with Benjamin to help him while they continued to hunt. The siblings lived happily together, sharing chores and meals, until one day, the girl plucked twelve lilies from the garden to present to her brothers. As soon as she did, they were transformed into twelve ravens, and the enchanted house vanished.\n\nLeft alone in the woods, the girl encountered an old woman who explained that the flowers were her brothers, now forever changed. The only way to free them was to remain silent and not laugh for seven years. Determined, the girl climbed a high tree and began to spin, vowing to keep her silence.\n\nOne day, a King hunting in the woods discovered her and was enchanted by her beauty. He asked her to marry him, but she remained silent, only nodding in response. They were married, but the King's mother, a wicked woman, slandered the Queen, claiming she was a low-born beggar. Eventually, the King, swayed by his mother\u2019s words, condemned his wife to death.\n\nAs the Queen was bound to the stake, the last moment of her seven years of silence arrived. Suddenly, twelve ravens swooped down from the sky, transforming back into her brothers. They extinguished the flames and freed their sister, who then explained her silence and the trials she had endured. The King rejoiced at her innocence, and together, they all lived happily ever after."""

After saying, \""Good-bye, Grethel,\"" he took the bacon, tied a string around it, and dragged it home. Unfortunately, the dogs came and ate it up, leaving him with just the string in his hand.\n\nWhen he arrived home, he greeted his mother with, \""Good evening, mother.\"" She asked, \""Where have you been?\"" He replied, \""To Grethel's, mother.\"" She inquired, \""What did you take her, Hans?\"" He explained, \""I took her nothing, but I brought away something.\"" His mother pressed, \""What did Grethel give you, Hans?\"" He answered, \""A piece of bacon, mother.\"" She asked, \""What did you do with it, Hans?\"" He replied, \""I tied a piece of string to it and led it home, but the dogs ate it, mother.\"" She scolded, \""That was very stupid of you, Hans. You ought to have carried it on your head.\"" Hans promised, \""All right! I'll do better next time, mother.\""\n\nWhen the next opportunity arose, Hans's mother asked, \""Where to, Hans?\"" He replied, \""To Grethel's, mother.\"" She reminded him, \""Manage well, Hans.\"" He assured her, \""All right! Good-bye, mother,\"" and set off. Upon reaching Grethel's, he greeted her, \""Good morning, Grethel.\"" She asked, \""What have you brought me?\"" Hans responded, \""I have brought nothing, but I want to take away something.\"" Grethel then gave him a calf. After saying, \""Good-bye, Grethel,\"" he set the calf on his head and carried it home, but the calf scratched his face along the way.\n\nWhen he arrived home, he greeted his mother with, \""Good evening, mother.\"" She asked, \""Where have you been?\"" He replied, \""To Grethel's, mother.\"" She inquired, \""What did you take her?\"" He explained, \""I took nothing, but I brought away something.\"" His mother pressed, \""What did Grethel give you?\"" He answered, \""A calf, mother.\"" She asked, \""What did you do with the calf, Hans?\"" He replied, \""I carried it home on my head, but it scratched my face.\"" She scolded, \""That was very stupid of you, Hans. You ought to have led home the calf and tied it to the manger.\"" Hans promised, \""All right! I'll do better next time, mother.\""\n\nWhen the next opportunity arose, Hans's mother asked, \""Where to, Hans?\"" He replied, \""To Grethel's, mother.\"" She reminded him, \""Manage well, Hans.\"" He assured her, \""All right, mother! Good-bye.\"" After reaching Grethel's, he greeted her, \""Good morning, Grethel.\"" She asked, \""What have you brought me today?\"" Hans responded, \""I have brought nothing, but I want to take away something.\"" Grethel then said, \""You shall take away me.\"" \n\nHans took Grethel, tied a rope around her neck, and led her home, fastening her up to the manger. When he returned to his mother, he greeted her with, \""Good evening, mother.\"" She asked, \""Where have you been?\"" He replied, \""To Grethel's, mother.\"" She inquired, \""What did you take her, Hans?\"" He answered, \""Nothing, mother.\"" She pressed, \""What did Grethel give you, Hans?\"" He replied, \""Nothing but herself, mother.\"" His mother asked, \""Where have you left Grethel, Hans?\"" He explained, \""I led her home with a rope and tied her up to the manger to eat hay, mother.\"" \n\nHis mother scolded, \""That was very stupid of you, Hans. You should have cast sheep's eyes at her.\"" Hans promised, \""All right, mother! I'll do better next time.\"" In a fit of misguided obedience, Hans went into the stable, took all the eyes out of the sheep, and threw them in Grethel's face. Angered, Grethel managed to get loose, ran away, and eventually became the bride of another."""
26,Robber Bridegroom,"""There was once a miller who had a beautiful daughter, and when she was grown up, he became anxious that she should be well married and taken care of. He thought, \""If a decent sort of man comes and asks her in marriage, I will give her to him.\"" Soon after, a suitor came forward who seemed very well to do, and as the miller knew nothing to his disadvantage, he promised him his daughter. However, the girl did not seem to love him as a bride should love her bridegroom; she had no confidence in him, and as often as she saw him or thought about him, she felt a chill at her heart.\n\nOne day, the suitor said to her, \""You are to be my bride, and yet you have never been to see me.\"" The girl replied, \""I do not know where your house is.\"" He then told her, \""My house is a long way in the wood.\"" She began to make excuses, saying she could not find the way to it, but the bridegroom insisted, \""You must come and pay me a visit next Sunday; I have already invited company, and I will strew ashes on the path through the wood, so that you will be sure to find it.\""\n\nWhen Sunday came, the girl set out on her way, feeling very uneasy without knowing exactly why. To prepare herself, she filled both pockets with peas and lentils. Although there were ashes strewed on the path through the wood, she cast a few peas on the ground at each step. She continued this until she reached the middle of the wood, where it was the darkest, and there stood a lonely house that did not look pleasant to her. She walked in, but there was no one there, and the greatest stillness reigned. Suddenly, she heard a voice cry, \""Turn back, turn back, thou pretty bride, within this house thou must not bide, for here do evil things betide.\""\n\nThe girl glanced around and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a cage by the wall. Again, it cried the same warning. Despite the bird's advice, the pretty bride went from one room to another through the whole house, but it was quite empty, and no soul was to be found. Eventually, she reached the cellar, where an old woman was nodding her head. \""Can you tell me,\"" asked the bride, \""if my bridegroom lives here?\"" \n\n\""Oh, poor child,\"" replied the old woman, \""do you know what has happened to you? You are in a place of cut-throats. You thought you were a bride, and soon to be married, but death will be your spouse. Look here, I have a great kettle of water to set on, and when once they have you in their power, they will cut you in pieces without mercy, cook you, and eat you, for they are cannibals. Unless I have pity on you and save you, all is over with you!\"" \n\nThe old woman then hid the bride behind a great cask, where she could not be seen. \""Be as still as a mouse,\"" said she; \""do not move or go away, or else you are lost. At night, when the robbers are asleep, we will escape. I have been waiting a long time for an opportunity.\"" No sooner was it settled than the wicked gang entered the house, bringing another young woman with them, dragging her along. They were drunk and would not listen to her cries and groans. They forced her to drink three glasses of wine\u2014one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow\u2014and then they cut her in pieces. \n\nThe poor bride trembled as she witnessed the fate the robbers had intended for her. One of them noticed a golden ring on the little finger of their victim, and as he could not draw it off easily, he took an axe and chopped it off. However, the finger jumped away and fell behind the cask on the bride's lap. The robber took up a light to look for it, but he could not find it. One of the others suggested, \""Have you looked behind the great cask?\"" But the old woman quickly interjected, \""Come to supper, and leave off looking till tomorrow; the finger cannot run away.\"" The robbers agreed and left off searching, sitting down to eat. \n\nThe old woman then dropped some sleeping stuff into their wine, and before long, they stretched themselves on the cellar floor, sleeping and snoring. When the bride heard this, she came from behind the cask and had to make her way among the sleepers lying all about on the ground. Fortunately, she passed through without awakening any of them, and the old woman followed her. They opened the door and made all haste to leave that house of murderers. The wind had carried away the ashes from the path, but the peas and lentils had budded and sprung up, and the moonlight showed them the way. They continued through the night until morning, when they reached the mill. The girl then related to her father all that had happened to her.\n\nWhen the wedding day came, friends and neighbors assembled, having been invited by the miller, and the bridegroom also appeared. Once everyone was seated at the table, each one had to tell a story. The bride sat still and said nothing until the bridegroom prompted her, \""Now, sweetheart, do you know no story? Tell us something.\"" She replied, \""I will tell you my dream. I was going alone through a wood, and I came at last to a house in which there was no living soul, but by the wall was a bird in a cage, who cried, 'Turn back, turn back, thou pretty bride, within this house thou must not bide, for evil things do here betide.'\""\n\nShe continued, \""And then again it said it. Sweetheart, the dream is not ended. Then I went through all the rooms, and they were all empty, and it was so lonely and wretched. At last, I went down into the cellar, and there sat an old woman, nodding her head. I asked her if my bridegroom lived in that house, and she answered, 'Ah, poor child, you have come into a place of cut-throats; your bridegroom does live here, but he will kill you and cut you in pieces, and then cook and eat you.' Sweetheart, the dream is not yet ended.\""\n\nShe went on, \""But the old woman hid me behind a great cask, and no sooner had she done so than the robbers came home, dragging with them a young woman, and they gave her to drink wine thrice, white, red, and yellow. Sweetheart, the dream is not yet ended. And then they killed her and cut her in pieces. Sweetheart, my dream is not yet ended. One of the robbers saw a gold ring on the finger of the young woman, and as it was difficult to get off, he took an axe and chopped off the finger, which jumped upwards and then fell behind the great cask on my lap. And here is the finger with the ring!\"" \n\nAt these words, she drew it forth and showed it to the company. The robber, who had grown deadly white during the story, sprang up and would have escaped, but the folks held him fast and delivered him up to justice. He and his whole gang were condemned and executed for their evil deeds."""
27,The Death Of The Hen,"""Once upon a time, the cock and the hen went to the nut mountain, agreeing beforehand that whichever of them found a nut would divide it with the other. The hen found a great big nut but said nothing about it, intending to eat it all alone. However, the kernel was so large that it got stuck in her throat, and she became afraid she would choke.\n\nIn her distress, the hen cried out, \""Cock! Run as fast as you can and fetch me some water, or I shall choke!\"" The cock hurried to the brook and pleaded, \""Brook, give me some water; the hen is up yonder choking with a big nut stuck in her throat.\"" The brook, however, replied, \""First run to the bride and ask her for some red silk.\""\n\nDetermined to help the hen, the cock ran to the bride and said, \""Bride, give me some red silk; the brook wants me to give him some red silk. I want him to give me some water, for the hen lies yonder choking with a big nut stuck in her throat.\"" The bride responded, \""First go and fetch me my garland that hangs on a willow.\"" \n\nThe cock dashed to the willow, pulled the garland from the bough, and brought it to the bride. In return, she gave him the red silk, which he took back to the brook. The brook then provided him with the water, and the cock hurried back to the hen. Unfortunately, it was too late; the hen had choked and lay there dead. The cock was heartbroken and cried aloud, causing all the beasts to come and lament for the hen. Six mice built a little wagon to carry her to her grave, and when it was ready, they harnessed themselves to it, with the cock driving.\n\nOn their way, they encountered the fox, who called out, \""Halloa, cock, where are you off to?\"" The cock replied, \""To bury my hen.\"" The fox asked, \""Can I come too?\"" and the cock agreed, saying, \""Yes, if you follow behind.\"" Soon, the fox was joined by the wolf, the bear, the stag, the lion, and all the beasts of the wood, forming a long procession.\n\nAs they continued, they reached a brook. The cock wondered, \""How shall we get over?\"" He noticed a straw in the brook and suggested, \""I will lay myself across, so that you may pass over on me.\"" However, when the six mice climbed onto the straw, it slipped, and they all tumbled into the water and drowned. \n\nNext, a coal offered to help by laying across the stream, but as soon as it touched the water, it hissed, went out, and died. A stone, feeling pity for the cock, decided to help and laid itself across the stream. The cock successfully drew the wagon with the dead hen to the other side. However, as he began to draw the others across, the weight was too much for him, and the wagon turned over, causing everyone to tumble into the water and drown.\n\nLeft all alone with the dead hen, the cock dug a grave, laid her in it, and raised a mound above her. He sat down and lamented so deeply that, in the end, he too died. Thus, they were all dead together."""
28,The Mouse The Bird And The Sausage,"""Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage lived together in perfect peace and great prosperity. The bird's responsibility was to fly to the forest every day to gather wood. The mouse took care of drawing water, making the fire, and setting the table, while the sausage was in charge of cooking. Despite their harmonious existence, the bird grew discontented, influenced by another bird he met on his journey, who called him a simpleton for doing all the hard work while the others enjoyed a more leisurely life.\n\nOne day, after the mouse had made the fire and drawn the water, she decided to rest in her little room until it was time to lay the table. Meanwhile, the sausage remained by the saucepans, ensuring the food was well-cooked. Just before dinner, he would stir the broth or stew several times to enrich and flavor it. When the bird returned home, they would sit down to a satisfying meal and then sleep soundly until the next morning. It was a life that seemed perfect.\n\nHowever, the bird resolved that he would no longer fetch wood. He felt he had been their slave long enough and insisted on a new arrangement. Despite the mouse and sausage's protests, the bird was determined to have his way. They decided to draw lots to determine their new roles, and it was decided that the sausage would fetch wood, the mouse would cook, and the bird would draw water.\n\nAs the sausage went off to gather wood, the bird made the fire, and the mouse prepared the pot, they eagerly awaited the sausage's return. However, the sausage took so long that the bird grew concerned and went part of the way to look for him. Not far down the road, he encountered a dog who, seeing the sausage as prey, had captured and eaten him. The bird lodged a complaint against the dog for being a robber, but the dog claimed the sausage had forged letters, justifying his actions.\n\nHeartbroken, the bird returned home with the wood and shared the sad news with the mouse. Despite their grief, they resolved to stay together and make the best of their situation. The bird laid the cloth, and the mouse prepared the food. In a desperate attempt to keep the tradition alive, the mouse climbed into the pot to stir and flavor the broth, but in doing so, she lost her fur, skin, and ultimately her life.\n\nWhen the bird came to serve dinner, he found no cook to be seen. He searched through the wood, but the mouse never appeared again. In a tragic turn of events, the wood caught fire, and in his haste to extinguish it, the bird accidentally dropped the bucket into the well and fell in after it. Unable to escape, he drowned, leaving behind the remnants of their once-happy household."""
29,Daniel O Rourke,"""People may have heard of the renowned adventures of Daniel O'Rourke, but how few are there who know that the cause of all his perils, above and below, was neither more nor less than his having slept under the walls of the Pooka's Tower. I knew the man well. He lived at the bottom of Hungry Hill, just at the right-hand side of the road as you go towards Bantry. An old man was he at the time he told me the story, with grey hair and a red nose; and it was on the 25th of June, 1813, that I heard it from his own lips, as he sat smoking his pipe under the old poplar tree, on as fine an evening as ever shone from the sky. I was going to visit the caves in Dursey Island, having spent the morning at Glengariff.\n\n\""I am often axed to tell it, sir,\"" said he, \""so that this is not the first time. The master's son, you see, had come from beyond foreign parts in France and Spain, as young gentlemen used to go before Buonaparte or any such was heard of; and, sure enough, there was a dinner given to all the people on the ground, gentle and simple, high and low, rich and poor. The ould gentlemen were the gentlemen, after all, saving your honour's presence. They'd swear at a body a little, to be sure, and, maybe, give one a cut of a whip now and then, but we were no losers by it in the end; and they were so easy and civil, and kept such rattling houses, and thousands of welcomes; and there was no grinding for rent, and there was hardly a tenant on the estate that did not taste of his landlord's bounty often and often in a year; but now it's another thing. No matter for that, sir, for I'd better be telling you my story.\""\n\nWell, we had everything of the best, and plenty of it; and we ate, and we drank, and we danced, and the young master, by the same token, danced with Peggy Barry, from the Bohereen--a lovely young couple they were, though they are both low enough now. To make a long story short, I got, as a body may say, the same thing as tipsy almost, for I can't remember, ever at all, no ways, how it was I left the place; only I did leave it, that's certain. Well, I thought, for all that, in myself, I'd just step to Molly Cronohan's, the fairy woman, to speak a word about the bracket heifer that was bewitched; and so, as I was crossing the stepping-stones of the ford of Ballyashenogh, and was looking up at the stars, and blessing myself--for why? it was Lady-day--I missed my foot, and souse I fell into the water. 'Death alive!' thought I, 'I'll be drowned now!' However, I began swimming, swimming, swimming away for dear life, till at last I got ashore, somehow or other, but never the one of me can tell how, upon a dissolute island.\n\nI wandered and wandered about there, without knowing where I wandered, until at last I got into a big bog. The moon was shining as bright as day, or your fair lady's eyes, sir (with your pardon for mentioning her), and I looked east and west, north and south, and every way, and nothing did I see but bog, bog, bog. I could never find out how I got into it; and my heart grew cold with fear, for sure and certain I was that it would be my berrin' place. So I sat upon a stone, which, as good luck would have it, was close by me, and I began to scratch my head, and sing the ULLAGONE--when all of a sudden the moon grew black, and I looked up and saw something for all the world as if it was moving down between me and it, and I could not tell what it was. Down it came with a pounce, and looked at me full in the face; and what was it but an eagle?--as fine a one as ever flew from the kingdom of Kerry!\n\nSo he looked at me in the face, and says he to me, 'Daniel O'Rourke,' says he, 'how do you do?' 'Very well, I thank you, sir,' says I; 'I hope you're well'; wondering out of my senses all the time how an eagle came to speak like a Christian. 'What brings you here, Dan?' says he. 'Nothing at all, sir,' says I, 'only I wish I was safe home again.' 'Is it out of the island you want to go, Dan?' says he. 'It is, sir,' says I; so I up and told him how I had taken a drop too much, and fell into the water; how I swam to the island; and how I got into the bog and did not know my way out of it.\n\n'Dan,' says he, after a minute's thought, 'though it is very improper of you to get drunk on a Lady-day, yet, as you are a decent sober man, who tends mass well, and never fling stones at me or mine, nor cries out after one in the field, my life for yours,' says he; 'so get up on my back, and grip me well for fear you'd fall off, and I'll fly you out of the bog.' 'I am afraid,' says I, 'your honour's making game of me; for whoever heard of riding a-horseback on an eagle before?' 'Upon the honour of a gentleman,' says he, putting his right foot on his breast, 'I am quite in earnest; and so now either take my offer or starve in the bog--besides I see that your weight is sinking the stone.'\n\nIt was true enough, as he said, for I found the stone every minute going from under me. I had no choice; so, thinks I to myself, faint heart never won fair lady, and this is fair persuadance. 'I thank your honour,' says I, 'for the loan of your civility; and I'll take your kind offer.' I therefore mounted on the back of the eagle, and held him tight enough by the throat, and up he flew in the air like a lark. Little I knew the trick he was going to serve me. Up, up, up--God knows how far he flew. 'Why, then,' said I to him--thinking he did not know the right road home--very civilly, because why? I was in his power entirely; 'sir,' says I, 'please your honour's glory, and with humble submission to your better judgment, if you'd fly down a bit, you're now just over my cabin, and I could be put down there, and many thanks to your worship.'\n\n'Arrah, Dan,' says he, 'do you think me a fool? Look down in the next field, and don't you see two men and a gun? By my word, it would be no joke to shoot this way, to oblige a drunken blackguard that I picked up off a could stone in a bog.' 'Bother you,' says I to myself, but I did not speak out, for where was the use? Well, sir, up he kept flying, flying, and I asking him every minute to fly down, and all to no use. 'Where in the world are you going, sir?' says I to him. 'Hold your tongue, Dan,' says he, 'and mind your own business, and don't be interfering with the business of other people.' 'Faith, this is my business, I think,' says I. 'Be quiet, Dan!' says he: so I said no more.\n\nAt last, where should we come to but to the moon itself. Now, you can't see it from this, but there is, or there was in my time, a reaping-hook sticking out of the side of the moon, this way (drawing the figure thus on the ground with the end of his stick). 'Dan,' says the eagle, 'I'm tired with this long fly; I had no notion it was so far.' 'And my lord, sir,' says I, 'who in the world axed you to fly so far--was it I? Did not I beg and pray and beseech you to stop half an hour ago?' 'There's no use talking, Dan,' said he; 'I'm tired bad enough, so you must get off, and sit down on the moon until I rest myself.' 'Is it sit down on the moon?' said I; 'is it upon that little round thing, then? Why, then, sure, I'd fall off in a minute, and be kilt and spilt, and smashed all to bits; you are a vile deceiver--so you are.' 'Not at all, Dan,' says he; 'you can catch fast hold of the reaping-hook that's sticking out of the side of the moon, and it will keep you up.' 'I won't, then,' said I. 'Maybe not,' said he, quite quiet.\n\n'If you don't, my man, I shall just give you a shake, and one slap of my wing, and send you down to the ground, where every bone in your body will be smashed as small as a drop of dew on a cabbage-leaf in the morning.' 'Why, then, I'm in a fine way,' said I to myself, 'ever to have come along with the likes of you'; and so, giving him a hearty curse in Irish, for fear he'd know what I said, I got off his back with a heavy heart, took hold of the reaping-hook and sat down upon the moon, and a mighty cold seat it was, I can tell you that.\n\nWhen he had me there fairly landed, he turned about on me, and said, 'Good morning to you, Daniel O'Rourke,' said he; 'I think I've nicked you fairly now. You robbed my nest last year' (it was true enough for him, but how he found it out is hard enough to say), 'and in return you are freely welcome to cool your heels dangling upon the moon like a cockthrow.' 'Is that all, and is this how you leave me, you brute, you,' says I. 'You ugly unnatural baste, and is this the way you serve me at last? Bad luck to yourself, with your hook'd nose, and to all your breed, you blackguard.' It was all to no manner of use; he spread out his great big wings, burst out a laughing, and flew away like lightning. I bawled after him to stop; but I might have called and bawled for ever, without his minding me. Away he went, and I never saw him from that day to this--sorrow fly away with him! You may be sure I was in a disconsolate condition, and kept roaring out for the bare grief, when all at once a door opened right in the middle of the moon, creaking on its hinges as if it had not been opened for a month before--I suppose they never thought of greasing them--and out there walks--who do you think but the man in the moon himself? I knew him by his bush.\n\n'Good morrow to you, Daniel O'Rourke,' says he, 'how do you do?' 'Very well, thank your honour,' says I. 'I hope your honour's well.' 'What brought you here, Dan?' said he. So I told him how I was a little overtaken in liquor at the master's, and how I was cast on a dissolute island, and how I lost my way in the bog, and the thief of an eagle promised to fly me out of it, and how, instead of that, he had fled me up to the moon.\n\n'Dan,' said the man in the moon, taking a pinch of snuff, when I was done, 'you must not stay here.' 'Indeed, sir,' says I, 'it is much against my will that I'm here at all; but how am I to go back?' 'That's your business,' said he; 'Dan, mine is to tell you that you must not stay, so be off in less than no time.' 'I'm doing no harm,' said I, 'only holding on hard by the reaping-hook lest I fall off.' 'That's what you must not do, Dan,' says he. 'Pray, sir,' says I, 'may I ask how many you are in family that you would not give a poor traveller lodging? I'm sure it is not often you're troubled with strangers coming to see you, for it is a long way.' 'I'm by myself, Dan,' says he, 'but you'd better let go the reaping-hook.' 'Faith, and with your leave,' says I, 'I'll not let go the grip, and the more you bids me the more I won't let go--so I will.' 'You had better, Dan,' says he again. 'Why, then, my little fellow,' says I, taking the whole weight of him with my eye from head to foot, 'there are two words to that bargain; and I'll not budge--you may, if you like.' 'We'll see how that is to be,' says he; and back he went, giving the door such a great bang after him (for it was plain he was huffed), that I thought the moon and all would fall down with it.\n\nWell, I was preparing myself to try strength with him, when back he comes, with the kitchen cleaver in his hand, and without saying a word he gives two bangs to the handle of the reaping-hook that was holding me up, and whap it came in two. 'Good morning to you, Dan,' says the spiteful little blackguard, when he saw me cleanly falling down with a bit of the handle in my hand; 'I thank you for your visit, and fair weather after you, Daniel.' I had no time to make any answer to him, for I was tumbling over and over, and rolling and rolling, at the rate of a fox-hunt. 'God help me!' says I, 'but this is a pretty pickle for a decent man to be seen in at this time of the night. I am now sold fairly.' The word was not out of my mouth, when, whiz! what should fly by close to my ear but a flock of wild geese, all the way from my own bog of Ballyasheenagh, else how should they know me?\n\nThe ould gander, who was their general, turning about his head, cried out to me, 'Is that you, Dan?' 'The same,' said I, not a bit daunted now at what he said, for I was by this time used to all kinds of bedivilment, and, besides, I knew him of ould. 'Good morrow to you,' says he, 'Daniel O'Rourke; how are you in health this morning?' 'Very well, sir,' says I, 'thank you kindly,' drawing my breath, for I was mightily in want of some, 'I hope your honour's the same.' 'I think it is falling you are, Daniel,' says he. 'You may say that, sir,' says I. 'And where are you going all the way so fast?' said the gander. So I told him how I had taken the drop, and how I came on the island, and how I lost my way in the bog, and how the thief of an eagle flew me up to the moon, and how the man in the moon turned me out. 'Dan,' said he, 'I'll save you; put out your hand and catch me by the leg, and I'll fly you home.' 'Sweet is your hand in a pitcher of honey, my jewel,' says I, though all the time I thought within myself that I don't much trust you; but there was no help, so I caught the gander by the leg, and away I and the other geese flew after him as fast as hops.\n\nWe flew, and we flew, and we flew, until we came right over the wide ocean. I knew it well, for I saw Cape Clear to my right hand, sticking up out of the water. 'Ah, my lord,' said I to the goose, for I thought it best to keep a civil tongue in my head anyway, 'fly to land, if you please.' 'It is impossible, you see, Dan,' said he, 'for a while, because, you see, we are going to Arabia.' 'To Arabia!' said I, 'that's surely some place in foreign parts, far away. Oh! Mr. Goose, why, then, to be sure, I'm a man to be pitied among you.'\n\n'Whist, whist, you fool,' said he, 'hold your tongue; I tell you Arabia is a very decent sort of place, as like West Carbery as one egg is like another, only there is a little more sand there.' Just as we were talking a ship hove in sight, sailing so beautiful before the wind. 'Ah, then, sir,' said I, 'will you drop me on the ship, if you please?' 'We are not fair over it,' said he; 'if I dropped you now you would go splash into the sea.' 'I would not,' says I, 'I know better than that, for it is just clean under us, so let me drop now at once.'\n\n'If you must, you must,' said he; 'there, take your own way'; and he opened his claw, and, faith, he was right--sure enough, I came down plump into the very bottom of the salt sea! Down to the very bottom I went, and I gave myself up, then, for ever, when a whale walked up to me, scratching himself after his night's sleep, and looked me full in the face, and never the word did he say, but, lifting up his tail, he splashed me all over again with the cold salt water till there wasn't a dry stitch upon my whole carcass! And I heard somebody saying--it was a voice I knew too--'Get up, you drunken brute, off of that'; and with that I woke up, and there was Judy with a tub full of water, which she was splashing all over me--for, rest her soul, though she was a good wife, she could never bear to see me in drink, and had a bitter hand of her own.\n\n'Get up,' said she again; 'and of all places in the parish, would no place sarve your turn to lie down upon but under the ould walls of Carrigapooka? An uneasy resting I am sure you had of it.' And, sure enough, I had, for I was fairly bothered out of my senses with eagles, and men of the moons, and flying ganders, and whales, driving me through bogs and up to the moon, and down to the bottom of the green ocean. If I was in drink ten times over, long would it be before I'd lie down in the same spot again, I know that!"""
31,Lawn Dyarrig,"""There was a King in his own time in Erin, and he went hunting one day. During his hunt, the King met a man whose head was out through his cap, whose elbows and knees were out through his clothing, and whose toes were out through his shoes. This man approached the King, gave him a blow on the face, and knocked three teeth from his mouth. The same blow sent the King's head into the dirt. When he rose from the earth, the King returned to his castle, where he lay down sick and sorrowful.\n\nThe King had three sons, named Ur, Arthur, and Lawn Dyarrig. The three were at school that day and came home in the evening. The father sighed when he saw his sons coming in. \""What is wrong with our father?\"" asked the eldest, Ur. \""Your father is sick on his bed,\"" said the mother. The three sons went to their father and asked what troubled him. The King explained, \""A strong man that I met today gave me a blow in the face, put my head in the dirt, and knocked three teeth from my mouth. What would you do to him if you met him?\"" \n\nUr replied, \""If I met that man, I would make four parts of him between four horses.\"" The King acknowledged him as his son. The King then turned to Arthur and asked the same question. Arthur said, \""If I had a grip on that man, I would burn him between four fires.\"" The King recognized him as his son too. Finally, he asked Lawn Dyarrig, \""What would you do?\"" Lawn Dyarrig replied, \""If I met that man, I would do my best against him, and he might not stand long before me.\"" The King, disappointed, declared, \""You are not my son. I would not lose lands or property on you. You must go from me and leave this tomorrow.\""\n\nThe following morning, the three brothers rose with the dawn. The order was given for Lawn Dyarrig to leave the castle and make his own way. The other two brothers planned to travel the world to find the man who had injured their father. Lawn Dyarrig lingered outside until he saw the two brothers setting off by themselves. \""It is a strange thing,\"" he said, \""for two men of high degree to go traveling without a servant.\"" Ur replied, \""We need no one,\"" and Arthur added, \""Company wouldn't harm us.\"" Eventually, they allowed Lawn Dyarrig to accompany them as a serving-boy.\n\nThey spent the day walking and came late to a house where a woman lived. She greeted Ur and Arthur warmly and welcomed Lawn Dyarrig, calling him the son of the King of Erin. \""It is a strange thing to shake hands with the elder and kiss the younger,\"" said Ur. The woman then shared a story, saying, \""The same as if your death were in it.\"" They spent the night in three parts: the first in conversation, the second in telling tales, and the third in eating and drinking, followed by sound sleep.\n\nThe next morning, the old woman prepared food for the young men. After they ate, she asked Ur what had driven them from home. Ur explained their quest to find the man who had harmed their father. The woman revealed, \""That was the Green Knight from Terrible Valley. I have lived here for three hundred years, and not a year has passed without three hundred heroes coming to Terrible Valley, and none have returned.\"" She warned them to turn back, but Ur vowed to continue. The woman then advised Lawn Dyarrig to return to her chamber, where he found the apparel of a hero.\n\nAfter donning the hero's clothing, the woman instructed him to search through old swords, and he found one that shone brightly after shaking off the rust. She then told him to take a slim white steed from the stable, which would carry him to the Eastern World without stopping. Lawn Dyarrig mounted the horse and caught up with his brothers, planting them behind him. The horse galloped swiftly, crossing hills and valleys until they reached the Eastern World.\n\nUpon arrival, Lawn Dyarrig cut the turf under the horse's right front foot, and Terrible Valley lay before him. He asked his brothers what they would prefer to do, and they chose to make a basket while he twisted gads. Lawn Dyarrig quickly finished the basket while his brothers struggled. When they asked who would go in the basket first, Ur volunteered but quickly cried to be pulled up, terrified of Terrible Valley. Arthur followed suit, but Lawn Dyarrig, determined, insisted he would go next.\n\nAs he ventured into Terrible Valley, he encountered seven hundred heroes guarding the land. When he inquired about the Green King's castle, they mocked him. However, Lawn Dyarrig fought fiercely, defeating them all. Afterward, he stopped to drink from a spring and fell asleep. The lady of the Green Knight, who came to fetch water, was startled to find him there. She roused him, and they quickly formed a bond, spending time together in the castle.\n\nThe lady explained that the Green Knight had taken her from her family but could not marry her for seven years. She warned Lawn Dyarrig that the Green Knight would return soon. When the knight arrived, he was furious to find Lawn Dyarrig there. The lady prepared dinner for him, and as they ate, the knight's brass head revealed his jealousy. He demanded the heart and liver of Lawn Dyarrig, sending heroes to fetch them, but each time, Lawn Dyarrig defeated them.\n\nEventually, the Green Knight, frustrated, called for more heroes, but Lawn Dyarrig outsmarted them all. After defeating the knight, Lawn Dyarrig and the lady celebrated their victory and spent the night together. The next morning, they gathered treasures, including the three teeth of the King, which Lawn Dyarrig found in the Green Knight's pocket. He placed the lady in a basket to send her home, giving her a ring to remember him by.\n\nWhen Ur and Arthur returned home with the lady, Ur mistakenly thought he could claim her as his own. However, the lady revealed Lawn Dyarrig's identity when she recognized the ring. Lawn Dyarrig returned to his father, restoring the three teeth to the King. The King was pleased, and since the lady would marry no one but Lawn Dyarrig, he became the bridegroom. \n\nAt the wedding, the bride presented a beautiful scarf to the Queen, which revealed the truth about Ur and Arthur's parentage. The Queen, under pressure, confessed that Ur was the gardener's son and Arthur was the swineherd's. Finally, when asked about Lawn Dyarrig, she truthfully declared him the King's son. With the truth revealed, the King granted Lawn Dyarrig half his kingdom, making Ur and Arthur his servants."""
32,Murtough And The Witch Woman,"""In the days when Murtough Mac Erca was in the High Kingship of Ireland, the country was divided between the old beliefs of paganism and the new doctrines of the Christian teaching. Part held with the old creed and part with the new, and the thought of the people was troubled between them, for they knew not which way to follow and which to forsake. The faith of their forefathers clung close around them, holding them by many fine and tender threads of memory and custom and tradition; yet still the new faith was making its way, and every day it spread wider and wider through the land.\n\nThe family of Murtough had joined itself to the Christian faith, and his three brothers were bishops and abbots of the Church, but Murtough himself remained a pagan, for he was a wild and lawless prince, and the peaceful teachings of the Christian doctrine, with its forgiveness of enemies, pleased him not at all. Fierce and cruel was his life, filled with dark deeds and bloody wars, and savage and tragic was his death, as we shall hear.\n\nNow Murtough was in the sunny summer palace of Cletty, which Cormac, son of Art, had built for a pleasure house on the brink of the slow-flowing Boyne, near the Fairy Brugh of Angus the Ever Young, the God of Youth and Beauty. A day of summer was that day, and the King came forth to hunt on the borders of the Brugh, with all his boon companions around him. But when the high noon came, the sun grew hot, and the King sat down to rest upon the fairy mound, and the hunt passed on beyond him, and he was left alone.\n\nThere was a witch woman in that country whose name was \""Sigh, Sough, Storm, Rough Wind, Winter Night, Cry, Wail, and Groan.\"" Star-bright and beautiful was she in face and form, but inwardly she was cruel as her names. And she hated Murtough because he had scattered and destroyed the Ancient Peoples of the Fairy Tribes of Erin, her country and her fatherland, and because in the battle which he fought at Cerb on the Boyne her father and her mother and her sister had been slain. For in those days, women went to battle side by side with men.\n\nShe knew, too, that with the coming of the new faith trouble would come upon the fairy folk, and their power and their great majesty would depart from them, and men would call them demons, and would drive them out with psalm-singing and with the saying of prayers, and with the sound of little tinkling bells. So trouble and anger wrought in the witch woman, and she waited the day to be revenged on Murtough, for he being yet a pagan, was still within her power to harm.\n\nSo when Sheen (for Sheen or \""Storm\"" was the name men gave to her) saw the King seated on the fairy mound and all his comrades parted from him, she arose softly, and combed her hair with her comb of silver adorned with little ribs of gold. She washed her hands in a silver basin wherein were four golden birds sitting on the rim of the bowl, and little bright gems of carbuncle set round about the rim. She donned her fairy mantle of flowing green, and her cloak, wide and hooded, with silvery fringes, and a brooch of fairest gold. On her head were tresses yellow like to gold, plaited in four locks, with a golden drop at the end of each long tress.\n\nThe hue of her hair was like the flower of the iris in summer or like red gold after the burnishing thereof. And she wore on her breasts and at her shoulders marvellous clasps of gold, finely worked with the tracery of the skilled craftsman, and a golden twisted torque around her throat. And when she was decked, she went softly and sat down beside Murtough on the turfy hunting mound. After a space, Murtough perceived her sitting there, and the sun shining upon her, so that the glittering of the gold and of her golden hair and the bright shining of the green silk of her garments was like the yellow iris-beds upon the lake on a sunny summer's day. Wonder and terror seized on Murtough at her beauty, and he knew not if he loved her or if he hated her the most; for at one moment all his nature was filled with longing and with love of her, so that it seemed to him that he would give the whole of Ireland for the loan of one hour's space of dalliance with her; but after that, he felt a dread of her, because he knew his fate was in her hands, and that she had come to work him ill.\n\nBut he welcomed her as if she were known to him and he asked her wherefore she was come. \""I am come,\"" she said, \""because I am beloved of Murtough, son of Erc, King of Erin, and I come to seek him here.\"" Then Murtough was glad, and he said, \""Dost thou not know me, maiden?\"" \""I do,\"" she answered, \""for all secret and mysterious things are known to me and thou and all the men of Erin are well known.\""\n\nAfter he had conversed with her awhile, she appeared to him so fair that the King was ready to promise her anything in life she wished, so long as she would go with him to Cletty of the Boyne. \""My wish,\"" she said, \""is that you take me to your house, and that you put out from it your wife and your children because they are of the new faith, and all the clerics that are in your house, and that neither your wife nor any cleric be permitted to enter the house while I am there.\""\n\n\""I will give you,\"" said the King, \""a hundred head of every herd of cattle that is within my kingdom, and a hundred drinking horns, and a hundred cups, and a hundred rings of gold, and a feast every other night in the summer palace of Cletty. But I pledge thee my word, oh, maiden, it were easier for me to give thee half of Ireland than to do this thing that thou hast asked.\"" For Murtough feared that when those that were of the Christian faith were put out of his house, she would work her spells upon him, and no power would be left with him to resist those spells.\n\n\""I will not take thy gifts,\"" said the damsel, \""but only those things that I have asked; moreover, it is thus, that my name must never be uttered by thee, nor must any man or woman learn it.\"" \""What is thy name,\"" said Murtough, \""that it may not come upon my lips to utter it?\"" And she said, \""Sigh, Sough, Storm, Rough Wind, Winter Night, Cry, Wail, Groan, this is my name, but men call me Sheen, for 'Storm' or Sheen is my chief name, and storms are with me where I come.\""\n\nNevertheless, Murtough was so fascinated by her that he brought her to his home, and drove out the clerics that were there, with his wife and children along with them, and drove out also the nobles of his own clan, the children of Niall, two great and gallant battalions. And Duivsech, his wife, went crying along the road with her children around her to seek Bishop Cairnech, the half-brother of her husband, and her own soul-friend, that she might obtain help and shelter from him.\n\nBut Sheen went gladly and light-heartedly into the House of Cletty, and when she saw the lovely lightsome house and the goodly nobles of the clan of Niall, and the feasting and banqueting and the playing of the minstrels and all the joyous noise of that kingly dwelling, her heart was lifted within her, and \""Fair as a fairy palace is this house of Cletty,\"" said she. \""Fair, indeed, it is,\"" replied the King; \""for neither the Kings of Leinster nor the Kings of mighty Ulster, nor the lords of the clans of Owen or of Niall, have such a house as this; nay, in Tara of the Kings itself, no house to equal this house of mine is found.\""\n\nAnd that night the King robed himself in all the splendour of his royal dignity, and on his right hand he seated Sheen, and a great banquet was made before them, and men said that never on earth was to be seen a woman more goodly of appearance than she. The King was astonished at her, and he began to ask her questions, for it seemed to him that the power of a great goddess of the ancient time was in her; and he asked her whence she came, and what manner was the power that he saw in her. He asked her, too, did she believe in the God of the clerics, or was she herself some goddess of the older world? For he feared her, feeling that his fate was in her hands.\n\nShe laughed a careless and a cruel laugh, for she knew that the King was in their power, now that she was there alone with him, and the clerics and the Christian teachers gone. \""Fear me not, O Murtough,\"" she cried; \""I am, like thee, a daughter of the race of men of the ancient family of Adam and of Eve; fit and meet my comradeship with thee; therefore, fear not nor regret. And as to that true God of thine, worker of miracles and helper of His people, no miracle in all the world is there that I, by mine own unaided power, cannot work the like. I can create a sun and moon; the heavens I can sprinkle with radiant stars of night. I can call up to life men fiercely fighting in conflict, slaughtering one another. Wine I could make of the cold water of the Boyne, and sheep of lifeless stones, and swine of ferns. In the presence of the hosts, I can make gold and silver, plenty and to spare; and hosts of famous fighting men I can produce from naught. Now, tell me, can thy God work the like?\""\n\n\""Work for us,\"" says the King, \""some of these great wonders.\"" Then Sheen went forth out of the house, and she set herself to work spells on Murtough, so that he knew not whether he was in his right mind or no. She took of the water of the Boyne and made a magic wine thereout, and she took ferns and spiked thistles and light puff-balls of the woods, and out of them she fashioned magic swine and sheep and goats, and with these she fed Murtough and the hosts. And when they had eaten, all their strength went from them, and the magic wine sent them into an uneasy sleep and restless slumbers.\n\nOut of stones and sods of earth, she fashioned three battalions, and one of the battalions she placed at one side of the house, and the other at the further side beyond it, and one encircling the rest southward along the hollow windings of the glen. Thus were these battalions, one of them all made of men stark-naked and their colour blue, and the second with heads of goats with shaggy beards and horned; but the third, more terrible than they, for these were headless men, fighting like human beings, yet finished at the neck; and the sound of heavy shouting as of hosts and multitudes came from the first and the second battalion, but from the third no sound save only that they waved their arms and struck their weapons together, and smote the ground with their feet impatiently. Though terrible was the shout of the blue men and the bleating of the goats with human limbs, more horrible yet was the stamping and the rage of those headless men, finished at the neck.\n\nMurtough, in his sleep and in his dreams, heard the battle-shout, and he rose impetuously from off his bed, but the wine overcame him, and his strength departed from him, and he fell helplessly upon the floor. Then he heard the challenge a second time, and the stamping of the feet without, and he rose again, and madly, fiercely, he set on them, charging the hosts and scattering them before him, as he thought, as far as the fairy palace of the Brugh. But all his strength was lost in fighting phantoms, for they were but stones and sods and withered leaves of the forest that he took for fighting men.\n\nNow Duivsech, Murtough's wife, knew what was going on. She called upon Cairnech to arise and to gather together the clans of the children of his people, the men of Owen and of Niall, and together they went to the fort; but Sheen guarded it well, so that they could by no means find an entrance. Then Cairnech was angry, and he cursed the place, and he dug a grave before the door, and he stood up upon the mound of the grave, and rang his bells and cursed the King and his house, and prophesied his downfall. But he blessed the clans of Owen and of Niall, and they returned to their own country.\n\nThen Cairnech sent messengers to seek Murtough and to draw him away from the witch woman who sought his destruction, but because she was so lovely, the King would believe no evil of her; and whenever he made any sign to go to Cairnech, she threw her spell upon the King, so that he could not break away. When he was so weak and faint that he had no power left, she cast a sleep upon him, and she went round the house, putting everything in readiness. She called upon her magic host of warriors and set them round the fortress, with their spears and javelins pointed inwards towards the house, so that the King would not dare to go out amongst them. And that night was a night of Samhain-tide, the eve of Wednesday after All Souls' Day.\n\nThen she went everywhere throughout the house, and took lighted brands and burning torches, and scattered them in every part of the dwelling. She returned into the room wherein Murtough slept and lay down by his side. She caused a great wind to spring up, and it came soughing through the house from the north-west; and the King said, \""This is the sigh of the winter night.\"" Sheen smiled, because, unwittingly, the King had spoken her name, for she knew by that that the hour of her revenge had come. \""It is I myself that am Sigh and Winter Night,\"" she said, \""and I am Rough Wind and Storm, a daughter of fair nobles; and I am Cry and Wail, the maid of elfin birth, who brings ill-luck to men.\""\n\nAfter that, she caused a great snowstorm to come round the house; and like the noise of troops and the rage of battle was the storm, beating and pouring in on every side, so that drifts of deep snow were piled against the walls, blocking the doors and chilling the folk that were feasting within the house. But the King was lying in a heavy, unresting sleep, and Sheen was at his side. Suddenly he screamed out of his sleep and stirred himself, for he heard the crash of falling timbers and the noise of the magic hosts, and he smelled the strong smell of fire in the palace.\n\nHe sprang up. \""It seems to me,\"" he cried, \""that hosts of demons are around the house, and that they are slaughtering my people, and that the house of Cletty is on fire.\"" \""It was but a dream,\"" the witch maiden said. Then he slept again, and he saw a vision, to wit, that he was tossing in a ship at sea, and the ship floundered, and above his head a griffin, with sharp beak and talons, sailed, her wings outspread and covering all the sun, so that it was dark as middle-night; and lo! as she rose on high, her plumes quivered for a moment in the air; then down she swooped and picked him from the waves, carrying him to her eyrie on the dismal cliff outhanging o'er the ocean; and the griffin began to pierce him and to prod him with her talons, and to pick out pieces of his flesh with her beak; and this went on awhile, and then a flame, that came he knew not whence, rose from the nest, and he and the griffin were enveloped in the flame. Then in her beak, the griffin picked him up, and together they fell downward over the cliff's edge into the seething ocean; so that, half by fire and half by water, he died a miserable death.\n\nWhen the King saw that vision, he rose screaming from his sleep and donned his arms; and he made one plunge forward seeking for the magic hosts, but he found no man to answer him. The damsel went forth from the house, and Murtough made to follow her, but as he turned, the flames leaped out, and all between him and the door was one vast sheet of flame. He saw no way of escape, save the vat of wine that stood in the banqueting hall, and into that he got; but the burning timbers of the roof fell upon his head and the hails of fiery sparks rained on him, so that half of him was burned and half was drowned, as he had seen in his dream.\n\nThe next day, amid the embers, the clerics found his corpse, and they took it up and washed it in the Boyne, and carried it to Tuilen to bury it. They said, \""Alas! that Mac Erca, High King of Erin, of the noble race of Conn and of the descendants of Ugaine the Great, should die fighting with sods and stones! Alas! that the Cross of Christ was not signed upon his face that he might have known the witchdoms of the maiden what they were.\""\n\nAs they went thus, bewailing the death of Murtough and bearing him to his grave, Duivsech, wife of Murtough, met them, and when she found her husband dead, she struck her hands together and she made a great and mournful lamentation; and because weakness came upon her, she leaned her back against the ancient tree that is in Aenech Reil; and a burst of blood broke from her heart, and there she died, grieving for her husband.\n\nThe grave of Murtough was made wide and deep, and there they laid the Queen beside him, two in the one grave, near the north side of the little church that is in Tuilen. Now, when the burial was finished, and the clerics were reciting over his grave the deeds of the King, and were making prayers for Murtough's soul that it might be brought out of hell, for Cairnech showed great care for this, they saw coming towards them across the sward a lonely woman, star-bright and beautiful, and a kirtle of priceless silk upon her, and a green mantle with its fringes of silver thread flowing to the ground. She reached the place where the clerics were, and saluted them, and they saluted her. They marveled at her beauty, but they perceived on her an appearance of sadness and of heavy grief.\n\nThey asked of her, \""Who art thou, maiden, and wherefore art thou come to the house of mourning? For a king lies buried here.\"" \""A king lies buried here, indeed,\"" said she, \""and I it was who slew him, Murtough of the many deeds, of the race of Conn and Niall, High King of Ireland and of the West. And though it was I who wrought his death, I myself will die for grief of him.\""\n\nAnd they said, \""Tell us, maiden, why you brought him to his death, if so be that he was dear to thee?\"" And she said, \""Murtough was dear to me, indeed, dearest of the men of the whole world; for I am Sheen, the daughter of Sige, the son of Dian, from whom Ath Sigi or the 'Ford of Sige' is called to-day. But Murtough slew my father, and my mother and sister were slain along with him, in the battle of Cerb upon the Boyne, and there was none of my house to avenge their death, save myself alone. Moreover, in his time the Ancient Peoples of the Fairy Tribes of Erin were scattered and destroyed, the folk of the underworld and of my fatherland; and to avenge the wrong and loss he wrought on them I slew the man I loved. I made poison for him; alas! I made for him magic drink and food which took his strength away, and out of the sods of earth and puff-balls that float down the wind, I wrought men and armies of headless, hideous folk, till all his senses were distraught. And now, take me to thee, O Cairnech, in fervent and true repentance, and sign the Cross of Christ upon my brow, for the time of my death is come.\"" \n\nThen she made penitence for the sin that she had sinned, and she died there upon the grave of grief and of sorrow after the King. And they dug a grave lengthways across the foot of the wide grave of Murtough and his spouse, and there they laid the maiden who had wrought them woe. And the clerics wondered at those things, and they wrote them and revised them in a book."""
33,The Corpse Watchers,"""There was once a poor woman who had three daughters. One day, the eldest said, \""Mother, bake my cake and kill my cock till I go seek my fortune.\"" The mother complied, and when everything was ready, she asked her daughter, \""Which will you have\u2014half of these with my blessing, or the whole with my curse?\"" The eldest replied, \""Curse or no curse, the whole is little enough.\"" With that, she set off, and whether the mother gave her a curse or not, she certainly did not receive her blessing.\n\nAs she walked, she soon grew tired and hungry. When she sat down to eat her dinner, a poor woman approached and asked for a bit. The eldest daughter coldly replied, \""The dickens a bit you'll get from me; it's all too little for myself.\"" The poor woman walked away sorrowfully. That night, she found lodging at a farmer's house, where the woman of the house offered her a spadeful of gold and a shovelful of silver if she would sit up and watch her son's corpse, which was waking in the next room. She agreed, and when the family went to bed, she sat by the fire, occasionally glancing at the corpse lying under the table.\n\nSuddenly, the dead man rose in his shroud and asked, \""All alone, fair maid?\"" She did not respond, and when he repeated the question for the third time, he struck her with a switch, turning her into a grey flag. About a week later, the second daughter set off to seek her fortune, disregarding her mother's blessing just like her sister. Unfortunately, she too met the same fate and was left a grey flag beside the first.\n\nFinally, the youngest daughter decided to search for her sisters. She made sure to carry her mother's blessing with her. On her journey, she shared her dinner with the poor woman she encountered on the road and promised to watch over her. She found lodging in the same place as her sisters and agreed to mind the corpse. Sitting by the fire with the dog and cat, she entertained herself with some apples and nuts given to her by the mistress. She thought it a pity that the handsome man under the table was a corpse.\n\nEventually, the corpse rose and asked, \""All alone, fair maid?\"" She quickly replied:\n\n\""All alone I am not,  \nI've little dog Douse, and Pussy, my cat;  \nI've apples to roast and nuts to crack,  \nAnd all alone I am not.\""\n\n\""Ho, ho!\"" he exclaimed, \""you're a girl of courage, though you wouldn't have enough to follow me. I am now going to cross the quaking bog, go through the burning forest, enter the cave of terror, climb the hill of glass, and drop from the top into the Dead Sea.\"" \""I'll follow you,\"" she declared, \""for I engaged to mind you.\"" He tried to deter her, but she was as determined as he was stout.\n\nHe leaped through the window, and she followed him until they reached the \""Green Hills.\"" There, he said:\n\n\""Open, open, Green Hills and let the light of the Green Hills through.\""  \n\""Aye,\"" said the girl, \""and let the fair maid too.\""\n\nThe hills opened, allowing them to pass through to the edge of a bog. He tread lightly over the shaky bits of moss and sod, while she pondered how to cross. Suddenly, an old beggar appeared, dressed nicely, and touched her shoes with a stick, causing the soles to spread a foot on each side. With this, she easily crossed the marsh. \n\nNext, they faced the burning woods, where the good fairy draped a damp, thick cloak over her, allowing her to pass through the flames unscathed. They then entered the dark cavern of horrors, where she would have heard terrifying yells, but the fairy stopped her ears with wax. She witnessed frightful sights surrounded by blue vapors and felt the sharp rocks and slimy backs of frogs and snakes.\n\nUpon exiting the cavern, they arrived at the mountain of glass. The fairy made her slippers sticky with a tap of her rod, enabling her to follow the young corpse easily to the top. There, the deep sea lay a quarter of a mile below. The corpse instructed her, \""Go home to my mother, and tell her how far you came to do her bidding. Farewell!\"" He then sprang headfirst into the sea, and without hesitation, she plunged after him.\n\nInitially stupefied, she soon regained her senses as they descended. After piercing through great depths, they spotted a green light below. Eventually, they found themselves in a beautiful meadow beneath the sea, where she half-slept with her head resting against his side. She couldn't keep her eyes open and lost track of time. When she awoke, she was in bed at his house, with him and his mother watching over her.\n\nIt turned out that a witch had a grudge against the young man for refusing to marry her, granting her the power to keep him in a state between life and death until a young woman rescued him by doing what she had done. At her request, her sisters regained their shapes and were sent back to their mother, accompanied by their spades of gold and shovels of silver. Perhaps they were better after that, but the youngest daughter married the young gentleman. It is said that they lived happily ever after, and if they didn't, may we!"""
34,Farmer And Badger,"""Long, long ago, there lived an old farmer and his wife who had made their home in the mountains, far from any town. Their only neighbor was a bad and malicious badger. This badger used to come out every night and run across to the farmer's field, spoiling the vegetables and the rice which the farmer spent his time carefully cultivating. The badger grew so ruthless in his mischievous work and did so much harm everywhere on the farm that the good-natured farmer could not stand it any longer and determined to put a stop to it. He lay in wait day after day and night after night with a big club, hoping to catch the badger, but all in vain. Eventually, he laid traps for the wicked animal.\n\nThe farmer's trouble and patience were rewarded when, one fine day, he found the badger caught in a hole he had dug for that purpose. The farmer was delighted at having caught his enemy and carried him home securely bound with rope. When he reached the house, he said to his wife, \""I have at last caught the bad badger. You must keep an eye on him while I am out at work and not let him escape because I want to make him into soup tonight.\"" Saying this, he hung the badger up to the rafters of his storehouse and went out to work in the fields. The badger was in great distress, for he did not like the idea of being made into soup that night. He thought and thought for a long time, trying to devise a plan to escape. It was hard to think clearly in his uncomfortable position, as he had been hung upside down.\n\nVery near him, at the entrance to the storehouse, stood the farmer's old wife, pounding barley. She looked tired and old, her face seamed with many wrinkles and as brown as leather. Every now and then, she stopped to wipe the perspiration rolling down her face. \""Dear lady,\"" said the wily badger, \""you must be very weary doing such heavy work in your old age. Won't you let me do that for you? My arms are very strong, and I could relieve you for a little while!\"" \n\n\""Thank you for your kindness,\"" said the old woman, \""but I cannot let you do this work for me because I must not untie you, for you might escape if I did, and my husband would be very angry if he came home and found you gone.\"" The badger, being one of the most cunning of animals, said again in a very sad, gentle voice, \""You are very unkind. You might untie me, for I promise not to try to escape. If you are afraid of your husband, I will let you bind me again before his return when I have finished pounding the barley. I am so tired and sore tied up like this. If you would only let me down for a few minutes, I would indeed be thankful!\""\n\nThe old woman had a good and simple nature and could not think badly of anyone. Much less did she think that the badger was only deceiving her to get away. She felt sorry for the animal as she turned to look at him. He looked in such a sad plight hanging downwards from the ceiling by his legs, which were all tied together so tightly that the rope and knots were cutting into the skin. In the kindness of her heart, and believing the creature's promise that he would not run away, she untied the cord and let him down. The old woman then gave him the wooden pestle and told him to do the work for a short time while she rested. He took the pestle, but instead of doing the work as he was told, the badger at once sprang upon the old woman, knocked her down with the heavy piece of wood, killed her, cut her up, and made soup of her, waiting for the return of the old farmer.\n\nThe old man worked hard in his fields all day, thinking with pleasure that no more would his labor be spoiled by the destructive badger. Towards sunset, he left his work and turned to go home. He was very tired, but the thought of the nice supper of hot badger soup awaiting his return cheered him. The thought that the badger might get free and take revenge on the poor old woman never once came into his mind.\n\nMeanwhile, the badger assumed the old woman's form. As soon as he saw the old farmer approaching, he came out to greet him on the veranda of the little house, saying, \""So you have come back at last. I have made the badger soup and have been waiting for you for a long time.\"" The old farmer quickly took off his straw sandals and sat down before his tiny dinner tray. The innocent man never even dreamed that it was not his wife but the badger who was waiting upon him and asked at once for the soup. Then the badger suddenly transformed himself back to his natural form and cried out, \""You wife-eating old man! Look out for the bones in the kitchen!\"" Laughing loudly and derisively, he escaped out of the house and ran away to his den in the hills.\n\nThe old man was left behind alone, hardly believing what he had seen and heard. When he understood the whole truth, he was so scared and horrified that he fainted right away. After a while, he came around and burst into tears, crying loudly and bitterly. He rocked himself to and fro in his hopeless grief. It seemed too terrible to be real that his faithful old wife had been killed and cooked by the badger while he was working quietly in the fields, congratulating himself on having once for all gotten rid of the wicked animal who had so often spoiled his fields. The horrible thought struck him; he had very nearly drunk the soup made from his poor old woman. \""Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\"" he wailed aloud.\n\nNot far away, there lived in the same mountain a kind, good-natured old rabbit. He heard the old man crying and sobbing and at once set out to see what was the matter and if there was anything he could do to help his neighbor. The old man told him all that had happened. When the rabbit heard the story, he was very angry at the wicked and deceitful badger and told the old man to leave everything to him; he would avenge his wife's death. The farmer was at last comforted and, wiping away his tears, thanked the rabbit for his goodness in coming to him in his distress.\n\nSeeing that the farmer was growing calmer, the rabbit went back to his home to lay his plans for the punishment of the badger. The next day, the weather was fine, and the rabbit went out to find the badger. He was not to be seen in the woods, on the hillside, or in the fields anywhere, so the rabbit went to his den and found the badger hiding there. The animal had been afraid to show himself ever since he had escaped from the farmer's house, fearing the old man's wrath. The rabbit called out, \""Why are you not out on such a beautiful day? Come out with me, and we will go and cut grass on the hills together.\""\n\nThe badger, never doubting that the rabbit was his friend, willingly consented to go out with him, glad to get away from the neighborhood of the farmer and the fear of meeting him. The rabbit led the way miles away from their homes, out on the hills where the grass grew tall, thick, and sweet. They both set to work to cut down as much as they could carry home to store for their winter's food. When they had each cut down all they wanted, they tied it in bundles and started homewards, with the rabbit making the badger go first.\n\nAs they walked, the rabbit took out a flint and steel, striking it over the badger's back as he stepped along in front, setting his bundle of grass on fire. The badger heard the flint striking and asked, \""What is that noise? 'Crack, crack'?\"" \""Oh, that is nothing,\"" replied the rabbit; \""I only said 'Crack, crack' because this mountain is called Crackling Mountain.\"" The fire soon spread in the bundle of dry grass on the badger's back. The badger, hearing the crackle of the burning grass, asked, \""What is that?\"" \""Now we have come to the 'Burning Mountain,'\"" answered the rabbit.\n\nBy this time, the bundle was nearly burned out, and all the hair had been burned off the badger's back. He now knew what had happened by the smell of the smoke from the burning grass. Screaming with pain, the badger ran as fast as he could to his hole. The rabbit followed and found him lying on his bed, groaning with pain. \""What an unlucky fellow you are!\"" said the rabbit. \""I can't imagine how this happened! I will bring you some medicine which will heal your back quickly!\"" The rabbit went away, glad and smiling, thinking that the punishment upon the badger had already begun. He hoped that the badger would die of his burns, feeling that nothing could be too bad for the animal guilty of murdering a poor helpless old woman who had trusted him.\n\nThe rabbit went home and made an ointment by mixing some sauce and red pepper together. He carried this to the badger, but before applying it, he told him that it would cause him great pain, but that he must bear it patiently because it was a very wonderful medicine for burns and scalds. The badger thanked him and begged him to apply it at once. But no language can describe the agony of the badger as soon as the red pepper was pasted all over his sore back. He rolled over and over and howled loudly. The rabbit, looking on, felt that the farmer's wife was beginning to be avenged.\n\nThe badger was in bed for about a month; but at last, in spite of the red pepper application, his burns healed, and he got well. When the rabbit saw that the badger was recovering, he thought of another plan to compass the creature's death. One day, he paid the badger a visit to congratulate him on his recovery. During the conversation, the rabbit mentioned that he was going fishing and described how pleasant fishing was when the weather was fine and the sea smooth.\n\nThe badger listened with pleasure to the rabbit's account of his fishing adventures, forgetting all his pains and his month's illness. He thought about how fun it would be to go fishing too, so he asked the rabbit if he would take him the next time he went out to fish. This was just what the rabbit wanted, so he agreed. He went home and built two boats, one of wood and the other of clay. At last, they were both finished, and as the rabbit stood and looked at his work, he felt that all his trouble would be well rewarded if his plan succeeded and he could manage to kill the wicked badger.\n\nThe day came when the rabbit had arranged to take the badger fishing. He kept the wooden boat for himself and gave the badger the clay boat. The badger, who knew nothing about boats, was delighted with his new boat and thought how kind it was of the rabbit to give it to him. They both got into their boats and set out. After going some distance from the shore, the rabbit proposed that they should try their boats and see which one could go the quickest. The badger fell in with the proposal, and they both set to work to row as fast as they could for some time. In the middle of the race, the badger found his boat going to pieces, for the water began to soften the clay. He cried out in great fear to the rabbit to help him. But the rabbit answered that he was avenging the old woman's murder and that this had been his intention all along. He was happy to think that the badger had at last met his deserts for all his evil crimes and was to drown with no one to help him. Then he raised his oar and struck at the badger with all his strength until he fell with the sinking clay boat and was seen no more.\n\nThus, at last, he kept his promise to the old farmer. The rabbit turned and rowed shorewards, and having landed and pulled his boat upon the beach, hurried back to tell the old farmer everything and how the badger, his enemy, had been killed. The old farmer thanked him with tears in his eyes. He said that until now he could never sleep at night or be at peace in the daytime, thinking of how his wife's death was unavenged. But from this time, he would be able to sleep and eat as of old. He begged the rabbit to stay with him and share his home, so from that day, the rabbit went to stay with the old farmer, and they both lived together as good friends to the end of their days."""
