In the enchanted fairy land, Santa Claus was known for his kindness and generosity. However, one day, he made a grave mistake. He had been warned by the fairy queen not to break the ice crystal, a magical object that kept the land frozen in winter. But Santa, being curious, decided to touch the crystal, and it shattered into a thousand pieces. The rules of the land were broken, and the queen was furious.

The fairy queen ordered a search for Santa across the planet Earth, threatening that if he didn't return, his beloved unicorn would be sacrificed. Santa was heartbroken at the thought of losing his dear companion. He realized that he had to return to the fairy land, but he was also afraid of the queen's wrath. In a desperate attempt to save his unicorn, Santa decided to return to the fairy land, but he was met with a shocking surprise. The queen had tricked him, and his unicorn was safe.

For two Christmases, Santa was in hiding, and the children were in despair. They had no gifts to look forward to, and their spirits were low. But Santa's parrot told him that the children were still looking forward to his return, and this gave him the courage to continue spreading happiness. Santa decided to return to work, but he had to be careful. He would leave in hiding at night, often disguised, and distribute gifts to the children.

One day, Santa decided to leave the fairy world and come to Earth for a stay. He was met with a surprise visit from the fairy queen, who was angry at his disobedience. But Santa was not afraid. He knew that he had the trust of his children, and this gave him the confidence to overcome any trouble. He started to fight, and despite being weak, the nature helped him through. Santa finally got hold of the glass crystal, and it was now over for the queen.

Santa was finally free, and he returned to Earth, where he was welcomed with open arms. But the fairy queen was not one to give up easily. She ordered her loyal subjects to catch Santa as he flew through the magic loop. But Santa was quick, and he jumped out of the loop, locking it tight so that the rest of the queen's loyals couldn't enter. Santa was finally safe, and he decided to live with the people of Earth. He was spotted by the queen, but he couldn't escape. He was taken into custody and taken to the queen, but instead of punishment, he was given a new chance. The queen realized that Santa's kindness and generosity were too great to be punished, and she decided to let him live his life as he pleased. Santa dedicated the rest of his life to bringing gifts to the children every Christmas, and he lived happily ever after.
