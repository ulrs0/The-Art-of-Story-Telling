Once upon a time, in a small village surrounded by a dense forest, there lived a young boy named Kaito. Kaito's best friend, a kind old man named Hiro, was like a grandfather to him. One day, while they were out on a walk, they stumbled upon a mysterious stranger who seemed to be lurking around the village. The stranger was known for his evil deeds, and the villagers warned Kaito and Hiro to stay away from him.

But the stranger was too cunning, and he managed to kidnap Hiro, tying him up and threatening to kill him if Kaito didn't do as he said. Kaito was devastated, but he refused to give up. He received a call from a random person who had found Hiro's phone on the road, and the stranger's voice was heard in the background, taunting Kaito to come and rescue his friend. The stranger told Kaito to meet him in the deep forest, where there were no lights and the only sound was the howling of wolves.

Kaito was terrified, but he knew he had to act fast. He made his way to the deep forest, his heart pounding in his chest. As he walked deeper into the forest, the trees seemed to close in around him, and the voices of the wolves grew louder. Suddenly, the stranger appeared, his gun pointed at Kaito's head. "You'll never leave this forest alive," he sneered. But Kaito refused to back down, and the stranger threatened to kill him if he didn't hand over the morning. Kaito knew he had to think fast, so he pretended to agree, but in reality, he had a plan.

In a split second, Kaito pulled out a knife he had hidden in his pocket and threatened the stranger, who laughed and pointed his gun at Kaito's head. But just as the stranger was about to pull the trigger, Hiro managed to free himself from his restraints and pulled out a hidden gun, shooting the stranger dead. Kaito was shocked, but he quickly untied Hiro and they ran out of the forest, hand in hand.

As they emerged from the forest, Kaito realized that they were not alone. There were many dead bodies scattered around, and the villagers had warned of a serial killer who had been terrorizing the area. The village elder approached them, his face stern. "Kaito, you have been given a difficult task. We need you to search the forest and find any more kidnappers or dead bodies. If you die, it's your fault." Kaito nodded bravely, knowing that he had to face his fears and protect his village. With Hiro by his side, he set off into the forest, determined to uncover the truth and bring justice to the victims.
