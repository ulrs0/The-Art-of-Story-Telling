Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a kind and hardworking girl named Jane. She had a best friend named Mary, and they did everything together. But one day, Jane's family was struggling to make ends meet, and she decided to move to Australia to find a good job and support her family. Mary was heartbroken to see her go, but Jane promised to stay in touch.

As Jane settled into her new life in Australia, she was overjoyed to see her family's condition improve. She was working hard and earning a good salary, which made her feel proud and happy. But little did she know, her new life was not without its challenges. Her colleague, Sia, was jealous of Jane's success and tried to bring her down. Sia would make false accusations and blame Jane for mistakes she hadn't made. But Jane was not one to give up easily. She continued to work hard and prove herself, and eventually, Sia realized that Jane was a good friend in disguise.

One day, Jane saved Sia from a big accident on the road, and later, she helped Sia by correcting her mistakes and taking the blame herself. Sia was grateful and apologized for her behavior. From then on, the two became good friends. Jane was happy to have someone to talk to and share her experiences with. But despite her new friendship, Jane couldn't shake off the feeling of loneliness. She missed her family and Mary terribly.

After a few months, Jane decided to visit her family in the village. She was overjoyed to see them happy and thriving, but she was also sad to see how much they had missed her. Her family told her that they had been lonely without her, and Jane realized that she couldn't bear to be apart from them anymore. So, she made the difficult decision to move her family to Australia with her. Jane was excited to start a new life with her family, but she knew it wouldn't be easy. She had to find jobs for her father and brother and a good school for her little sister.

It wasn't long before Jane's family settled into their new life in Australia. Jane's father found a good job, her brother started working as well, and her sister was happy in her new school. Jane even helped Mary find a good job in Australia, and the two friends were reunited at last. Jane was finally surrounded by her family and friends, and she knew that she had made the right decision. She was no longer alone, and she was grateful for the new life she had built for herself and her loved ones.
