In the misty mountains of ancient China, Violet, a brave and determined young warrior, set out on a perilous journey to find her long-lost commander. She had heard rumors that he was hiding in the mountains, and she was determined to find him. Despite the warnings from the villagers to avoid the treacherous mountains, Violet pressed on, driven by her unwavering resolve.

As she ventured deeper into the mountains, Violet was met with a crushing force of magic that sent her crashing into the wall behind her. Her arm was broken, and she was left battered and bruised. The kokiri, mischievous creatures with magical whimsical powers, attacked her, using their cunning to try and enslave her. They took advantage of her unusual size, forcing her to carry out laborious tasks for them. Violet, desperate for a place to stay, reluctantly agreed to comply with their demands.

However, Violet's life as a slave was short-lived. She soon discovered that her parents were in dire need of a rare herb to cure their illness, and she knew that the general, a wise and powerful warrior, might be able to help her. Violet decided to embark on a new journey, this time to find the general and seek his advice. She traveled through the kokiri mountains, facing numerous challenges and obstacles along the way. Finally, she reached the general's camp, where she was greeted with open arms and a special chariot to aid her in her quest.

With the general's guidance and the rare herbs in hand, Violet set out to return to her village. However, the kokiri, enraged by her escape, chased after her, determined to capture her once again. Violet, using her military training and sheer strength, managed to evade her pursuers and return to her village. There, she was met with skepticism and mistrust, as the villagers refused to believe her incredible story.

Undeterred, Violet set out to prove her tale, following the mountain trail to gather the rare herbs that would save her parents' lives. As she walked, the villagers began to notice the change in her, and they started to believe her story. When the neighbors, who had been trying to sabotage Violet's efforts, were unable to provide any proof of their claims, they were sidelined by the village. In the end, Violet's parents were cured, and she was hailed as a hero. Though she was forced to do the kokiri's bidding for a time, Violet eventually returned to her normal life, her parents healthy and happy, and she lived out the rest of her days as a brave and determined warrior.
