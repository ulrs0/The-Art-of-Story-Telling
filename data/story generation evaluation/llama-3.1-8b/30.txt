In a bustling city, two friends, Alex and Ryan, had been inseparable since childhood. They went on countless adventures together, exploring every nook and cranny of their hometown. However, one day, Alex decided to take a trip to a foreign country, leaving Ryan behind. Ryan was excited for his friend, but little did he know that Alex's trip would take a dark turn.

As soon as Alex arrived in the foreign country, he was lured into a life of crime by a group of shady individuals. They promised him a life of luxury and power, but in reality, Alex was forced to become a drug pimp in a dodgy neighborhood. Ryan, unaware of Alex's new life, received a warning from unknown sources that Alex was not the same person he used to know. Despite this, Ryan decided to investigate further and went looking for Alex. However, he was captured by Alex's men and forced to become a prostitute on the streets of the neighborhood.

As Ryan struggled to survive in this new reality, Alex's men told him that their boss was looking for him. Alex, still struggling with his own demons, had heard about Ryan's capture and was determined to take action. He ordered his men to kill anyone who got in their way, and in a fit of rage, he chopped off Ryan's left arm. But as Ryan lay on the ground, he realized that Alex was not acting like himself. It was his PTSD that was causing all this anger and violence.

In a desperate attempt to reach Alex, Ryan confessed his love for him, hoping that it would snap him out of his trance-like state. But instead of calming him down, it only made Alex more aggressive. He attacked Ryan, chopping off his second arm and then his foot. Ryan died a painful death due to blood loss. Alex, still consumed by his dark side, continued to wreak havoc on the neighborhood, leaving a trail of destruction in his wake.

Years went by, and Ryan's family held a mock funeral to suppress their grief. But the truth about Ryan's death remained a secret. Meanwhile, Alex's men continued to terrorize the neighborhood, and a new prisoner was brought in to take Alex's place. The prisoner, who had fallen in love with Ryan, tried to take on Alex's persona and rule the neighborhood with an iron fist. But 50 years later, two skeletons were found in the neighborhood, and a DNA test confirmed that they were indeed Alex and Ryan. The prisoner was arrested and put in jail on suspicion of murdering them. As the news of Ryan's death finally came to light, a group of people visited his grave, and a mysterious inscription was found on the tombstone: "He died trying to bring back the love of his life."
