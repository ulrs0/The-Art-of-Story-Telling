In a small village, there lived a young girl named Ella. Her mother, a wise and kind woman, loved Ella dearly, but she knew that the world outside their village was full of dangers. Monsters roamed the forest, and her mother wanted to protect Ella from them. So, she made a difficult decision: she put Ella to sleep for 14 long years, hoping that by the time Ella woke up, the world would be a safer place.

When Ella finally woke up, she found herself in a strange and unfamiliar world. Her mother had left her a letter, warning her not to go to the west side of the forest, where the monsters were known to roam. But Ella was curious, and she decided to explore the forest anyway. As she walked, she noticed that the monsters were following her, their foot trails leading them straight to her. Ella tried to lose them, but they were relentless, and she knew she had to be careful.

As the days passed, Ella and the monsters found themselves in a desperate situation. They were running short of water, and Ella knew that they had to find a way to get some. She decided to clear the river path, hoping that it would lead them to a source of fresh water. But when she woke up the next morning, she found that there was no water in the taps. The river was clogged, and they were in trouble. Ella knew that she had to act fast, so she decided to unclog the river and get the water flowing again.

It wasn't an easy task, and Ella soon found herself struggling to clear the river. She was badly injured, but she refused to give up. As she worked, she created a ring of protection around herself, using her own strength and determination to keep the monsters at bay. But just as she was making progress, she felt a strange sensation wash over her. She was being pulled towards the river, and she knew that she was in grave danger.

Just as all hope seemed lost, Ella's mother appeared out of nowhere, her magical powers glowing brightly. She had been watching over Ella from afar, and she knew that it was time to intervene. With a wave of her hand, she sent the monsters fleeing, and she scooped Ella up in her arms. "It's time for you to come home," she said, smiling. And with that, Ella was swimming back to the village, her mother by her side. But as they arrived, Ella's mother revealed a surprise: she was no longer needed to protect Ella, because Ella was now old enough to take care of herself. And with that, Ella's mother disappeared, leaving Ella to take care of the house and business on her own.
