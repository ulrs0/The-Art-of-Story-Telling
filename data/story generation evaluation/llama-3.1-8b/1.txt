Once upon a time, in a small village surrounded by lush green forests, there lived two brothers, elder and younger. The elder brother was known for his kindness and helpful nature, while the younger brother was a bit mischievous. One day, the elder brother decided to go to the forest to gather some fruits for his family. As he was walking, he got stuck in a deep pothole and couldn't get out. The villagers tried to help him, but they couldn't reach him.

Meanwhile, back in the village, strange things started to happen. The lights at the house began to flicker, and the villagers heard a loud crash in the forest. It turned out that a tree had fallen, blocking the only road out of the village. The villagers were worried, but the elder brother's family was more concerned about their food supply. They had almost nothing left to eat, and the crops were starting to decay. The elder brother knew he had to do something, so he sent some spies to gather information about the situation.

The spies returned with some surprising news. They had met a wise old man who told them about a secret cavern filled with a freshly harvested crop of fruits. The elder brother was overjoyed and decided to visit the cavern. As he entered the cavern, he was amazed by the abundance of fruits. He knew that this was the answer to his family's problem. He gathered as much food as he could and set off to find a way to get back to the village.

However, his journey was not without challenges. He had to navigate through the forest, avoiding the king's guards who were trying to catch him. He also had to find a way to get to the island where the king lived. As he was walking, he realized that he had lost the last coin he had, which was meant to buy food for his family. He was worried, but he didn't give up. He used his wits to outsmart the guards and eventually reached the island.

When he arrived at the island, he was greeted by the king himself. But to his surprise, the king was not angry with him. Instead, he was grateful. It turned out that the king had been poisoning the water supply for the crops in the elder brother's village, causing them to decay. The king had been trying to get rid of the villagers, but the elder brother's kindness and determination had exposed his plan. The king was so impressed that he decided to reward the elder brother and his family. He returned the lost coin and gave them baskets full of fruits as a reward. The villagers were overjoyed, and the elder brother's family was finally able to eat their fill. The king also restored the water supply, and the crops began to grow again. The villagers celebrated the elder brother's bravery and kindness, and he was hailed as a hero.
