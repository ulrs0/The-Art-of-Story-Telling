In the small town of Ashwood, where Peters parents had mysteriously disappeared when he was just a little boy, strange rumors swirled about his father's involvement with a secret organization. Peters had grown up with a sense of unease, never quite knowing the truth. One night, while exploring the old church, Alice stumbled upon a secret meeting of the town's elders, dressed in antique clothing, bowing to a statue with a dark and satanic presence. She knew she had to keep this a secret.

As she made her way home, she coincidentally changed routes due to a car crash and saw Harry, her former boyfriend, secretly enter an old building on the side of the road. Unbeknownst to her, Harry was involved in some shady dealings, and upon seeing Anna look at him with suspicion, he ran after her with his gun to stop her from escaping. The police found Anna running on the streets, and Harry acted as if he was being accused by the hysterical woman. But little did they know, Harry had a sinister plan, and Anna was soon kidnapped.

Meanwhile, in a different part of the country, Arnold's family was trapped in a cellar under a logistic warehouse, kidnapped by a ruthless man named Jauger. Arnold, a war veteran, struggled to cope with the PTSD that had been plaguing him since his return from the war. He couldn't sleep, and his family was suffering because of it. Desperate for a solution, Arnold decided to take on mercenary work, hoping to stay away from his family as long as possible.

But fate had other plans. Arnold received a call to go to war-torn Syria, where he would face off against the notorious Jaguar squad. A gruesome gunfight erupted between the two hostile parties, and Arnold was left for dead. But as he lay on the ground, he made a desperate deal with a mysterious force, selling his soul to become an incarnate for an avenging constellation. With supernatural powers, Arnold was able to heal quickly and see with eagle-like precision.

With his newfound abilities, Arnold was able to track down Jauger and his men, who were holding his family captive in the logistic warehouse cellar. He infiltrated the building, taking out the guards one by one, and finally reached his family. Overjoyed to be reunited, they were able to escape and make their way back home through secret trade routes from Syria to the American-allied parts of the Middle East. But as they settled back into their lives, they knew they couldn't stay hidden for long, as other hostile parties were closing in on them, threatening their newfound peace.
