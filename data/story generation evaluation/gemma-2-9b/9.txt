Bartholomew was a simple baker, known for his delicious pastries and his unfortunate affliction: a limp. One day, two shadowy figures arrived at his shop, demanding he bake them a cake infused with the tears of a unicorn. They threatened to expose Bartholomew's secret â€“ that he wasn't actually a baker, but a powerful wizard in disguise! Terrified, Bartholomew agreed, but secretly vowed to find a way to escape their clutches.

He knew unicorns only shed tears when riding over a rainbow, so he set off on a daring adventure. He found a shimmering rainbow arching across the sky and, with a flick of his wrist, summoned a magnificent unicorn. They soared through the air, the unicorn's horn catching the sunlight and creating a shower of glittering tears. Bartholomew collected them carefully, his limp forgotten in the thrill of the journey.

Back in his shop, he baked the cake, but instead of using the unicorn tears, he replaced them with a secret ingredient: potent fart bombs! When the shadowy figures tasted the cake, they were overcome by a wave of uncontrollable flatulence, their faces turning a bright shade of purple. Bartholomew, seizing his chance, used his magic to brand them with a symbol of shame, then vanished into thin air.

The shadowy figures, humiliated and defeated, vowed revenge. They followed Bartholomew's trail through the jungle, their eyes narrowed, but his limp left a telltale pattern in the muddy ground. Bartholomew, however, had a trick up his sleeve. He used his magic to become invisible, then leaped onto his unicorn, who galloped away, leaving the shadowy figures lost and confused.

Finally safe, Bartholomew was summoned to the king's palace. The king, impressed by his bravery and resourcefulness, offered him a difficult task: solve a Rubik's Cube without using magic. Bartholomew, determined to prove his worth, spent days and nights twisting and turning the cube, finally solving it with a triumphant grin. As a reward, the king showered him with gifts, including a magnificent chocolate waterfall that flowed endlessly from a golden fountain. Bartholomew, the once-simple baker, had become a hero, his limp a reminder of his past struggles and his courage.
