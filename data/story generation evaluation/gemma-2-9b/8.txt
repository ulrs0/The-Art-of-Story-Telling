The twins, Finn and Flora, were inseparable. They loved playing hide-and-seek, sharing secrets, and most importantly, always answering each other's calls. One day, Finn went out to the market, promising to call Flora as soon as he returned. But the call never came. Days turned into weeks, and Flora's worry grew into a chilling fear. She finally learned the truth from a stranger: Finn had been kidnapped.  

The kidnapper, a shadowy figure known only as "The Bag Man," demanded a hefty ransom. He threatened to harm Finn if Flora didn't comply.  Desperate and terrified, Flora tried to raise money, but their family was struggling financially.  The Bag Man, a cruel and cunning man, grew impatient. He sent a chilling message: if Flora didn't deliver the money by nightfall, Finn would be gone forever.

Flora, driven by love and desperation, decided to take a desperate gamble. She remembered an old story her grandmother told her about a hidden village in a distant country, a place where people lived outside the law and where The Bag Man might be vulnerable.  She packed a small bag, leaving behind a note for her family, and set off on a perilous journey.

The journey was long and fraught with danger. Flora finally reached the village, a hidden haven nestled in a valley. She found The Bag Man, but he was surrounded by his henchmen.  He laughed at her naive attempt to confront him, and in a moment of brutal swiftness, he struck her down.  

Flora awoke in a dark, damp cell.  She was weak and injured, but her spirit remained unbroken.  She knew she had to escape.  She managed to overpower a guard, steal his clothes, and make her way out of the village.  She took The Bag Man's money, the only thing she could take from him, and disappeared into the night.  She knew she could never return home, but she carried Finn's memory with her, a promise to never give up hope.
