Finn had always been a bit of a dreamer, always off on some adventure. So when he told his best friend, Liam, he was going to visit a faraway land, Liam wasn't surprised. But weeks turned into months, and Finn didn't return. Liam, worried sick, started asking around. Whispers reached him, unsettling whispers about Finn's supposed transformation. He was no longer the kind, gentle Finn Liam knew. He was now a ruthless figure, the kingpin of a shadowy underworld.

Desperate to find his friend, Liam ventured into the dangerous neighborhood where Finn was said to reside. He was quickly captured, forced into a life he never imagined. He was made to walk the streets, a pawn in Finn's twisted game. Meanwhile, Finn, consumed by a darkness he couldn't understand, heard whispers of a new addition to his ranks. A foreigner, someone who looked familiar. A chilling realization dawned on him - it could be Liam.  

Rage, fueled by a past he couldn't escape, consumed Finn. He slaughtered the men responsible for Liam's capture, the blood staining the streets a gruesome red.  His PTSD, a constant shadow, took hold, and he unleashed a terrifying fury upon the neighborhood.  He was a whirlwind of violence, a monster driven by a pain he couldn't articulate.  Liam, witnessing this carnage, saw a flicker of the Finn he knew, a glimpse of the friend he desperately wanted to save. He confessed his love, a desperate plea for the man he thought he knew to return.

But Finn, lost in his own darkness, couldn't hear Liam's words. He saw Liam's love as a weakness, a vulnerability he couldn't afford. In a fit of rage, he severed Liam's arm, a brutal act that echoed the pain Finn carried within. Liam, bleeding and broken, knew he had to act. He sought out a hidden market, a place where the impossible was possible. There, he found a robotic arm, a symbol of his determination to survive. But in the depths of that market, he found something else - a prisoner, a man who mirrored his own pain and longing.

Liam, fueled by a love that transcended pain and loss, returned to Finn, bringing with him the prisoner and a glimmer of hope. But Finn, consumed by his demons, saw only a threat. He attacked, severing Liam's other arm and then his leg. Liam, unarmed and bleeding, fought with the last vestiges of his strength, but it was not enough. He died in Finn's arms, his love a silent echo in the darkness.  Years later, two skeletons were found in the heart of the neighborhood, their bones intertwined. A DNA test confirmed their identities - Finn and Liam, forever bound by a love that even death couldn't sever.
