Finn loved playing pranks, but his latest one went too far. He'd swapped the sugar in the baker's pantry with salt, thinking it would be hilarious. Instead, the whole village woke up to burnt, salty bread, and everyone blamed Finn. The baker, furious, declared Finn would have to work for him for a year to make amends. Finn was devastated. He overheard the baker talking to a shady merchant, whispering about selling Finn to a faraway island where he'd be forced to mine precious gems. Terrified, Finn decided to run away.

That night, under the cloak of darkness, Finn snuck onto a small fishing boat docked at the harbor. He sailed through the night, guided only by the stars, until he reached a lush, green island shrouded in mist. He knew he couldn't stay hidden forever, but he hoped to find a way to survive on his own. As he explored the island, he stumbled upon a hidden cave. Inside, a strange, glowing crystal pulsed with an ethereal light. As Finn reached out to touch it, a jolt of energy surged through him, and suddenly, his eyes began to glow with a brilliant, fiery light.

Finn soon discovered he could shoot beams of concentrated light from his eyes, powerful enough to cut through trees and melt rocks. He used his newfound power to build a shelter, hunt for food, and defend himself from wild animals. He even learned to control the intensity of his beams, using them to start fires and illuminate the dark caves.

One day, the merchant's ship arrived at the island, searching for Finn. They had tracked him down and were determined to take him back. But Finn was ready. He stood on a cliff overlooking the beach, his eyes blazing with power. With a focused blast of energy, he sent the ship crashing against the rocks, sending the merchant and his men fleeing in terror.

Finn realized he had found a home on the island. He built a small hut near the beach, where he spent his days swimming in the crystal-clear waters, exploring the lush forests, and honing his laser vision. He was no longer the mischievous prankster, but a protector of his newfound paradise. He knew he would never forget his past, but he was finally free, living a life filled with adventure and wonder.
