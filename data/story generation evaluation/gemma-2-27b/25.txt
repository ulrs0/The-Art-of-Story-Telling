Jane felt a pang of sadness every time she thought about her best friend, Mary.  Moving to Australia for a better job had been the right decision for her family, but Jane missed Mary terribly. Her teacher had once said that loneliness was a heavy burden, and Jane was starting to understand what she meant.  Even though she was helping her family by sending money back home, the ache in her heart wouldn't go away. Seeing her family's life improve brought Jane joy, but it wasn't the same without Mary by her side.

Jane threw herself into her work, determined to make the most of her opportunity. She excelled at her job, earning praise from her boss and the envy of a colleague named Sia. Sia, jealous of Jane's success, tried to sabotage her, making false accusations and blaming Jane for her own mistakes. Jane, however, remained kind, even saving Sia from a near accident on the road.  She continued to help Sia, correcting her errors and shielding her from their boss's wrath. Slowly, Sia began to see Jane's true nature, realizing that beneath her success was a heart of gold. Their rivalry transformed into a genuine friendship.

After months of hard work, Jane decided to visit her family. She was overjoyed to see them thriving, their faces glowing with happiness. But as she spent time with them, she realized how much they missed her too. The loneliness she felt in Australia was mirrored in their eyes.  Jane made a decision. She would bring her family to Australia, ending their separation and creating a new life together.

The journey back to Australia was filled with excitement. This time, Jane wasn't alone. She was bringing her family to a new beginning.  Finding jobs for her father and brother, and a good school for her little sister, proved to be a challenge, but Jane tackled it with determination. She knew that the happiness of her family was worth every effort.

Soon, Jane's family was settled in Australia, their lives filled with joy and security. Jane even managed to convince Mary to move to Australia, finding her a good job and welcoming her into their new life.  Surrounded by her family and her best friend, Jane finally felt complete. The loneliness she had carried for so long had vanished, replaced by the warmth of love and togetherness.
