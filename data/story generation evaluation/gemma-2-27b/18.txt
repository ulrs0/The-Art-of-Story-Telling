Violet, a young woman with a heart full of determination, set out on a perilous journey to find her long-lost commander. Ignoring warnings about the treacherous Kokiri Mountains, she ventured forth, only to be met with a blast of magic that shattered her arm and sent her crashing into a rocky wall. Dazed and injured, she was surrounded by the mischievous Kokiri, tiny creatures with whimsical powers who saw Violet's size as an opportunity. They tricked her, promising shelter and safety in exchange for her labor, enslaving her to their whims.

Desperate to find her commander and unaware of her parents' plight, Violet toiled under the Kokiri's rule. One day, a faded note fluttered from an old book, revealing that her parents were gravely ill and needed rare herbs found only in the mountains. Determined to save them, Violet decided to seek her commander's help. He was her only hope.  She escaped the Kokiri, her heart heavy with the weight of her mission. The general, a wise and compassionate man, listened to her story and gifted her the precious herbs, along with a sturdy chariot to navigate the treacherous mountain paths.

Violet's journey back was fraught with danger. The Kokiri, enraged by her escape, pursued her relentlessly, their angry faces illuminated by torches, their weapons glinting in the moonlight. But Violet, remembering the general's teachings on patience and resilience, used her strength and wit to outmaneuver them, disappearing into the shadows when they least expected it.

Finally, Violet returned home, her chariot laden with the life-saving herbs. However, her tale of the Kokiri and her escape was met with skepticism.  Undeterred, she followed the mountain trail, gathering more herbs, proving her story true. The village, witnessing her dedication and the abundance of herbs, finally believed her. The neighbors, unable to provide any proof to the contrary, were sidelined, and Violet's parents, thanks to the herbs, recovered.

Though Violet was forced to continue serving the Kokiri as a consequence of her escape, she found solace in knowing her parents were safe. She returned to her normal life, forever changed by her adventure. The experience taught her the importance of perseverance, the power of compassion, and the strength that lies within.
