Maya felt a knot in her stomach as the moving truck pulled away, leaving her standing alone on the curb. Her parents had promised to visit often, but their words felt hollow. They were so busy with their new lives, their emails and calls became less frequent, filled with vague apologies and promises they never kept. Maya had tried to tell them how lonely and scared she felt, but they brushed it off, saying she was just adjusting.  She was left to navigate the unfamiliar school, the confusing bus routes, and the ache of missing her old life all by herself.

One day, during a routine checkup, the doctor discovered a lump in Maya's throat. Fear gripped her. She was alone, sick, and terrified. But then, the doctor, a kind woman with warm eyes, took Maya's hand and promised to help. She connected Maya with a support group for teens dealing with similar health issues. There, Maya found solace and friendship, a lifeline in the sea of loneliness.

Fueled by anger and a desperate need for change, Maya decided to confront her parents. She flew to their new city, bursting into their luxurious apartment, her voice shaking with rage. She slapped her father, the words tumbling out in a torrent of hurt and betrayal.  For the first time, they saw the pain they had caused. They apologized, their faces etched with remorse. Maya felt a flicker of satisfaction, a sense of justice served.

Determined to start fresh, Maya moved to a new country, leaving behind the ghosts of her past. She enrolled in a coding bootcamp, her mind buzzing with a new purpose. She would learn to code, to build a future for herself, and maybe, just maybe, help her family who had abandoned her.

Every day, Maya immersed herself in the world of algorithms and programming languages. She practiced tirelessly, her fingers flying across the keyboard. Her goal was ambitious: to hack into the security system of a renowned bank and transfer the money her parents had stashed away, the money they had promised to use for her education. It was a risky plan, but Maya was driven by a fierce determination to reclaim what was rightfully hers and build a life free from the pain of abandonment.
