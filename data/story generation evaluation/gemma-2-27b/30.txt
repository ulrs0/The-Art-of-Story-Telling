Liam had always been the adventurous one, the one who'd disappear for weeks on end, exploring hidden corners of the world. This time, though, something felt different. Whispers reached Finn, Liam's childhood friend, painting a chilling picture of Liam's disappearance. He wasn't lost, they said, but had become something else entirely, a ruthless figure controlling a dark underbelly in a distant city. Fear gnawed at Finn, but loyalty compelled him to find his friend.

He ventured into the city's shadowy heart, only to be ensnared by Liam's men. Forced into a life of prostitution, Finn was stripped of his dignity, his hope dwindling with each passing day. Unbeknownst to him, Liam, haunted by his own demons, had learned of Finn's capture. A wave of rage, fueled by his own fractured psyche, consumed him. He slaughtered the men responsible, but the bloodlust didn't stop there. It spread like wildfire, engulfing the entire neighborhood in a storm of violence.

As Liam's rampage raged, Finn, battered and broken, realized the man before him wasn't the Liam he knew. This was a monster born of trauma, a shell of the friend he'd cherished. Desperation clawed at him, and in a moment of raw vulnerability, he confessed his love for Liam, hoping to reach the flicker of humanity buried deep within. Liam, however, was lost in the abyss of his own making. He lashed out, severing Finn's arm, a chilling testament to his descent into darkness.

Finn, clinging to life, escaped the carnage. He sought refuge in the city's underbelly, finding solace in the arms of another captive, a prisoner who offered him kindness and a glimmer of hope. With a newfound resolve, Finn returned to Liam, his heart heavy with a love that bordered on madness. But Liam, consumed by his own darkness, saw only a threat. He attacked, severing Finn's remaining arm and then his leg. Finn bled out, his love for Liam a tragic epitaph to their shattered friendship.

Fifty years later, the skeletons of two men were unearthed in the ruins of the neighborhood. DNA tests confirmed their identities: Liam and Finn. The prisoner, who had assumed Liam's mantle, was apprehended, his reign of terror finally over. Finn's remains were laid to rest, a silent testament to a love that transcended even death. The whispers of their story lingered, a cautionary tale of friendship, betrayal, and the devastating power of unchecked darkness.
