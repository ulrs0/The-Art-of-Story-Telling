Once upon a time, in a small village surrounded by a dense forest, there lived two brothers. One day, the elder brother ventured into the forest to gather fruit but got stuck in a deep pothole. Back at home, the lights began to flicker mysteriously, and soon after, a massive tree fell, blocking the only road out of town. The younger brother, worried about his sibling and the strange occurrences, sent spies to gather information. The spies returned with news that the king had taken an interest in their plight and offered to help in exchange for a favor.

As days passed, the family's food supply dwindled, and they were on the brink of starvation. To make matters worse, the crops in their fields began to decay mysteriously. Determined to save his family, the younger brother set out on a journey to find food and uncover the reason behind the failing crops. During his quest, he stumbled upon a secret cavern filled with a bountiful, unspoiled harvest of fruits. With renewed hope, he gathered as much as he could carry and continued his journey.

Guided by a wise old man, the younger brother made his way to the island where the king resided. However, upon arrival, he discovered that his last coin, meant to purchase food, had been misplaced. In a clever move, he tricked a deceitful merchant who had stolen the coin, using the merchant's own traps against him. Victorious, he secured enough food to sustain his family and returned to his village.

Upon his return, the younger brother uncovered a sinister plot: the king had been poisoning the village's water supply, causing the crops to decay. Realizing the gravity of the situation, he confronted the king, who, in a desperate attempt to cover his tracks, sent his guards disguised as villagers to tail the younger brother. However, the truth could not be hidden for long.

In a surprising turn of events, the king arrived in the village, presenting the younger brother with his lost coin and expressing his gratitude for revealing the truth. The king, now remorseful, vowed to make amends. The village's water supply was restored, and the family was awarded baskets full of fruits as a reward. The village celebrated with a grand feast, and the younger brother was hailed as a hero, ensuring that they all lived happily ever after.
