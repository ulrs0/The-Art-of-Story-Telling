Once upon a time, in a small village surrounded by a dense forest, lived a brave young boy named Leo. One day, Leo's best friend, Max, mysteriously disappeared. Despite warnings from the villagers to stay away from the forest, Leo ventured into the woods to find Max. As he searched, he received a chilling phone call from a stranger who had found Max's phone on the road. The stranger urged Leo to come quickly, hinting that Max was in grave danger.

Leo followed the directions given by the stranger and found himself deep in the forest, where the trees blocked out all light and eerie voices echoed around him. Suddenly, he stumbled upon a clearing where a sinister figure, the villain, had tied Max to a tree and was threatening to kill him. The villain noticed Leo and demanded that he leave or face the same fate as Max. Leo, determined to save his friend, refused to back down.

A fierce struggle ensued. Leo, armed only with a small knife he had hidden in his pocket, tried to fend off the villain, who brandished a gun. The villain laughed at Leo's feeble attempt and pointed the gun at his head, beginning a countdown from five. Just as the villain reached the final number, a shot rang out. Max, who had managed to free one of his hands, had used a hidden gun to save Leo. The villain fell to the ground, defeated.

Leo quickly untied Max, and the two friends ran through the forest, their hearts pounding with fear. They didn't stop until they reached the safety of their village. The villagers were relieved to see them alive and praised their bravery. However, their ordeal was not over yet.

The village elders tasked Leo and Max with a difficult mission: to search the forest for any other victims or kidnappers, as many had gone missing in those woods. Despite their fear, Leo and Max accepted the challenge, knowing that their courage could save others. Together, they ventured back into the forest, determined to uncover its dark secrets and bring peace to their village.
