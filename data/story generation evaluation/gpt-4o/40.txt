Jake's eccentric, genius grandfather, Gramps, had always been known for his wild experiments, but this time, he had outdone himself. He built a portal to another dimension, Dimension X-9, for his latest scientific endeavor. However, something went terribly wrong, and Gramps was sucked into the parallel universe, leaving behind only cryptic notes about the dimension he entered. Before disappearing, Gramps left Jake a warning on his tablet: "Don’t follow me into Dimension X-9! The creatures there can get inside your head and twist your thoughts! Trust no one!" But Jake, worried about his grandfather, ignored the warning and used Gramps’ portal gun to follow him into Dimension X-9. As soon as he arrived, he started seeing strange visions, and the world around him shifted and warped unpredictably, making it hard to tell what was real.

In Dimension X-9, the villain, an entity called the Mind Shaper, discovered Jake’s fear of losing his grandfather through the dimension’s mental tricks. It used this fear to manipulate Jake, creating illusions of Gramps being in danger to control Jake’s actions. The Mind Shaper used the illusion of Gramps being captured and tortured to lure Jake into a trap. It planned to use Jake’s bond with his grandfather to force him to hand over Gramps’ portal gun, which the villain needed to escape Dimension X-9. The Mind Shaper tried to trick Jake by disguising itself as Gramps, creating a scenario where “Gramps” pretended to have escaped but told Jake he must give up the portal gun to stop a greater threat from another dimension. Overwhelmed with worry and guilt, Jake wanted to believe that his grandfather was safe and followed the instructions of the fake Gramps, giving the Mind Shaper the portal gun.

The Mind Shaper attacked Gramps by trapping him in a mental prison, where he was forced to relive his worst mistakes over and over again, leaving him disoriented and unable to help Jake escape Dimension X-9. Back in the real world, Jake’s family was in trouble. The technology Gramps left behind was malfunctioning and causing small dimensional rifts to appear in their home, growing larger and more dangerous, threatening to consume the entire neighborhood. Jake learned about the dimensional rifts when he received a distress signal on Gramps’ communicator watch. His mom called in a panic, describing the strange occurrences at home, and warned him that if he didn’t fix it soon, the whole town could be pulled into another dimension. Realizing the only way to save his family and stop the rifts was to defeat the Mind Shaper and free Gramps from his mental prison, Jake decided to continue deeper into Dimension X-9 to find the core of the Mind Shaper’s power and destroy it.

Jake embarked on a journey through Dimension X-9’s bizarre landscapes, facing a twisted reality where time bent and space warped. He navigated through chaotic floating islands, encountered strange creatures, and avoided dimensional traps set by the Mind Shaper. For passing the tests, Jake gained a special device from Gramps’ toolbox that allowed him to manipulate small portions of reality in Dimension X-9. This device gave him the power to break the Mind Shaper’s illusions and restore parts of the dimension to normal. Jake traveled to the Mind Nexus, the core of Dimension X-9, a surreal, shifting landscape where the Mind Shaper's power was strongest. He faced the Mind Shaper in a battle where the environment constantly warped to disorient him. The Mind Shaper used illusions of Jake’s family and time distortions to distract and weaken him. However, Jake outsmarted the Mind Shaper by trapping it in its own illusion, severing its connection to Dimension X-9, freeing his grandfather, and defeating the villain.

Jake and Gramps used the portal gun to open a gateway back to the real world, returning just in time to stop the last of the dimensional rifts from tearing their house apart. As they tried to leave Dimension X-9, a weakened Mind Shaper attempted one last desperate attack, creating a false portal to trap Jake in the dimension forever. Jake realized the portal was a trap when his reality-warping device revealed the illusion. He created a real portal and quickly escaped with Gramps before the Mind Shaper could capture them. Back home, Jake was not recognized because the prolonged exposure to Dimension X-9 had altered his appearance. His hair now glowed faintly, and his eyes had a strange, otherworldly sheen, making him look unrecognizable to his family and friends. The town council tasked Jake with repairing the remaining damage caused by the rifts, believing Gramps was too old to handle it. Using the reality-warping device, Jake neutralized the remaining rifts, stabilizing the anomalies one by one. Finally, Jake was celebrated as the true hero of the town, building a better relationship with Gramps, who begrudgingly admitted Jake saved the day.
