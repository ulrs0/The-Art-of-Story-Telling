Roger was a young time agent who had a strange dream one night. In the dream, an unknown figure warned him about a rupture in the space-time continuum. The next day, Roger noticed strange disturbances and explosions, but he failed to inform his friends. Suddenly, a time vortex appeared and sucked them into an alternate timeline. The evil scientist, Mr. Everhart, whose experiments had caused the rupture, was searching for a secret element. He lured Roger to the moon with a decoy base, distracting him while he continued his search.

Realizing his friends were kidnapped and held hostage on the moon, Roger decided to rescue them. He noticed the disturbances on the moon and tracked down his friends. Determined to stop Mr. Everhart's plan, Roger embarked on a space mission in his spaceship. Upon arriving on the moon, he received state-of-the-art equipment that would aid him in his quest. Armed with new technology, Roger set out to confront the villain.

On the moon, Roger discovered that Mr. Everhart had a mega robot ready to defend his base. Using his new belt that allowed him to pause time, Roger managed to destroy the robots and the boss robot. He freed his friends and sent Mr. Everhart to prison. The love for his friends gave Roger the final boost he needed to defeat the robot army. With his mission accomplished, Roger and his friends traveled back to Earth in their spaceship.

However, the journey back was not easy. The remaining robots pursued them, trying to destroy their ship and capture Roger. In a fierce battle, Roger managed to kill all the robots, ensuring their safe return. But when they arrived back on Earth, the time vortex had reset everyone's minds, and they had forgotten Roger existed. Roger was given the difficult task of saving all of space-time and his friends from Mr. Everhart once again.

Using his toolkit, special belt, and guns, Roger forced Mr. Everhart to fix the timeline. His brother, who had forgotten him, now stood tall, claiming to have stopped the evil scientist. Finally recognized for his efforts, Roger was reunited with his friends and given the appropriate credit for saving the world. With peace restored, Roger retired from his job as a time agent, ready to live a peaceful life with his friends.
