Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a girl named Jane who had to move to Australia for a good job to support her poor family. Jane's best friend, Mary, was heartbroken when Jane left, and Jane herself found it hard to adjust to her new life without Mary and the fun activities they used to do together. Jane's teacher had once told her that loneliness could be very depressing and that family and friends were an essential part of life. Jane missed her friend dearly but knew she had to stay strong for her family's sake.

In Australia, Jane worked hard and sent money back home, which greatly improved her family's situation. This gave her immense satisfaction and made her feel proud of her efforts. However, Jane's colleague, Sia, was very jealous of her success and often tried to bring her down with false accusations and blame. Despite Sia's actions, Jane remained kind and even saved Sia from a big accident one day. Over time, Jane's kindness and helpfulness made Sia realize that Jane was a good person and a friend in disguise. Their rivalry turned into a strong friendship.

After a few months, Jane decided to visit her family. She was overjoyed to see them happy and in good condition, but she also saw how much they missed her. Jane decided to move her family to Australia so they could all be together. She was thrilled to be returning to Australia with her family, knowing that her loneliness would finally come to an end.

Settling her family in Australia was a challenging task. Jane had to find jobs for her father and brother and a good school for her little sister. Despite the difficulties, Jane's determination and hard work paid off. Her family settled well, and they never faced financial issues again. Jane even managed to bring Mary to Australia and helped her find a good job.

In the end, Jane was never alone again. She was always surrounded by her loving family and her best friend, Mary. They all lived happily together in Australia, grateful for the love and support they shared. And so, Jane's story became a beautiful tale of friendship, family, and the power of kindness.
