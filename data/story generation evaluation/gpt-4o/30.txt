Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived two best friends, Alex and Ben. One summer, Alex decided to go on an adventure to a faraway land. Days turned into weeks, and Ben received no word from Alex. Worried, Ben set out to find his friend, despite warnings from mysterious sources that Alex had become the feared leader of a dangerous gang in a notorious neighborhood. Ignoring the warnings, Ben ventured into the dark alleys, only to be captured by Alex's men and forced into a life of misery.

When Alex heard about a new captive in his gang, he was curious and demanded to see him. To his horror, he discovered it was Ben. Overcome with rage, Alex killed the men responsible for capturing Ben, but the sight of blood triggered his PTSD, sending him into a violent frenzy. In his madness, Alex convinced himself that he no longer cared about friends or family, only power. This self-deception led him deeper into darkness.

During the chaos, Alex accidentally chopped off Ben's arm. The pain jolted Ben into realizing that Alex's actions were driven by his trauma, not his true self. Desperate to reach the friend he once knew, Ben confessed his love for Alex, hoping to break through the darkness. Despite his injuries, Ben embarked on a perilous journey to an underground market to find a robotic arm, where he met a kind-hearted prisoner who helped him and became his new love.

Ben returned to Alex, hoping to save him with the support of his new partner. But the sight of Ben's new love pushed Alex over the edge. In a fit of rage, Alex attacked Ben, severing his other arm and even his foot. Ben fought bravely but succumbed to his injuries, dying in the streets. His death went unnoticed, and his family, unaware of his fate, held a mock funeral to cope with their loss.

Years later, two skeletons were discovered in the neighborhood. DNA tests confirmed they were Alex and Ben. The prisoner who had helped Ben was arrested, suspected of their murders. Ben's skeleton was finally given a proper burial, and his grave became a place of remembrance for those who visited, honoring the brave friend who had tried to save his lost companion.
