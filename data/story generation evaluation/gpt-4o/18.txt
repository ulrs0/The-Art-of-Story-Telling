Once upon a time in ancient China, a brave girl named Violet set out on a journey to find her long-lost commander. Despite warnings not to travel through the treacherous Kokiri Mountains, Violet pressed on, determined to reunite with him. As she ventured deeper into the mountains, a powerful magical force struck her, breaking her arm and slamming her into a wall. The mischievous Kokiri, small magical beings, attacked her and, seeing her unusual size, decided to enslave her to carry out their labor. They tricked Violet into complying by promising her a place to stay.

Violet's parents were in dire need of rare herbs for their treatment, but they couldn't afford them. One day, Violet discovered a note about the herbs falling out of an old book. Determined to help her parents, she decided to find the general herself and ask for his advice. She embarked on a journey through the Kokiri Mountains, where she eventually received the rare herbs from the general, who was moved by her bravery and determination.

Guided by the general's wisdom, Violet returned to the Kokiri Mountains. She struggled fiercely but managed to break free from the Kokiri's grasp. Through her military training, she learned the power of patience and used it to outsmart her captors. With her newfound strength and wisdom, Violet emerged victorious, clutching the precious herbs.

Violet received the herbs and set off on an alternative path around the mountains, riding in a special chariot given to her by the general. The Kokiri, angered by her escape, chased her with torches, maces, and weapons. Using her sheer strength and wit, Violet managed to evade them when no one was looking, finally making her way back home.

Upon her return, the villagers mistrusted Violet's stories, thinking they were mere fiction. She faced the difficult task of proving she had the herbs. Following the mountain trail, she presented the herbs to the village. When the neighbors couldn't provide any proof of their own, they were sidelined, and Violet's parents were saved. Though Violet was forced to do the Kokiri's bidding for a time, she eventually returned to a normal life with her healthy parents, living happily ever after.
