Once upon a time, in a faraway land, two friends, Leo and Max, were inseparable. They did everything together, from exploring the woods to playing in the park. One day, Leo decided to go on a trip to a foreign country, and Max stayed behind. But when Leo didn't return, Max began to worry. He received a mysterious message warning him that Leo was not who he used to be, that he had become a powerful and ruthless leader in a dark neighborhood.

Despite the warning, Max decided to search for Leo. He traveled to the foreign country and ventured into the dodgy neighborhood, but he was captured by Leo's men and forced into a life of prostitution. Leo, however, had no idea that his friend was among the people he was exploiting. When he finally discovered the truth, he was overcome with rage and killed the men responsible. But his anger didn't stop there, and he went on a violent rampage, killing anyone in his path.

As Max suffered at the hands of Leo's men, he realized that his friend was not in control of his actions. Leo's past traumas had triggered a deep-seated anger, and he was no longer the kind and gentle person Max once knew. In a desperate attempt to reach out to Leo, Max confessed his love for him. But Leo, consumed by his darkness, chopped off Max's arm. Max, determined to survive, visited an underground market and found a prisoner who helped him acquire a robotic arm.

With his new arm, Max returned to Leo, hoping to bring him back from the brink of destruction. But Leo, now fully embracing his dark side, attacked Max, chopping off his other arm and his foot. Max, unable to defend himself, died from blood loss. His death went unreported, and his family, unaware of his fate, held a mock funeral to cope with their grief.

Years went by, and the neighborhood where Leo and Max met their fate became a place of dark legend. But 50 years later, two skeletons were discovered, and a DNA test revealed that they belonged to Leo and Max. The prisoner who had helped Max was found to be impersonating Leo and ruling the neighborhood. He was arrested and put in jail, suspected of murdering the two friends. Max's skeleton was finally given a proper burial, and a group of people visited his grave, remembering the tragic tale of two friends who were torn apart by darkness and violence.
