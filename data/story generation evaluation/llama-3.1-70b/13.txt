Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a young girl named Maria. She lived with her parents, who were very busy with their own lives, often leaving Maria to fend for herself. They would often talk about moving to a big city, but Maria wasn't sure if she wanted to go. Her parents would give her mixed signals, sometimes saying they would stay, and other times saying they would leave. One day, they finally made the decision to move, but they left Maria behind, saying she would join them later. Maria was left all alone, struggling to take care of herself.

As time passed, Maria's life became harder and harder. She had to work multiple jobs to make ends meet, and she started to feel the strain on her health. She would often get sick, and one day, during a routine doctor's visit, the doctor discovered that Maria had a serious health problem. But the doctor was kind and provided Maria with emotional support, helping her to feel less alone. Maria realized that she needed to take action against her parents, who had abandoned her and left her to suffer. She decided to confront them and make them pay for their actions.

Maria traveled to the city where her parents lived and confronted them. She was so angry that she slapped her mother and yelled at her, demanding to know why they had left her behind. The argument went on for hours, but finally, Maria's parents realized their mistake and apologized. Maria felt a sense of satisfaction and victory, knowing that she had stood up for herself. She decided to leave the country and start a new life in a foreign land, where she could leave her past behind.

As Maria settled into her new life, she started to rebuild herself. She kept track of her parents' activities, making sure they didn't hurt anyone else the way they had hurt her. But she also made sure to change her own activities every day, trying new things and meeting new people. She started to feel like a new person, free from the pain of her past.

Maria's new life was not easy, but she was determined to make a better life for herself and her family. She decided to learn how to code, so she could build a better future. She worked hard and eventually created a code that could hack into the security system of a renowned bank. She used this code to transfer all the money in her parents' account to her own, so she could help her family and start anew. Maria finally felt like she had found her place in the world, and she was grateful for the journey that had brought her there.
