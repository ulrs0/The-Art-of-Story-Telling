Roger had always been a skilled time agent, but nothing could have prepared him for the dream he had one night. In the dream, a mysterious figure warned him about the space-time continuum rupturing, and he knew he had to act fast. However, he failed to inform his friends, and before he knew it, they were sucked into a time vortex and transported to an alternate timeline.

As Roger tried to make sense of what was happening, he received a message from the evil scientist, Mr. Everhart, who had been experimenting with the space-time continuum. Mr. Everhart lured Roger to the moon, claiming that he had discovered a secret element that could change the course of history. Roger, being a skilled agent, was not one to fall for tricks easily, but he couldn't resist the temptation to investigate. As he landed on the moon, he noticed explosions and ruptures, and a secret base that seemed to be the source of the disturbance. Unbeknownst to Roger, this was just a decoy, and Mr. Everhart was using him as a distraction while he searched for the real secret element.

Roger soon discovered that his friends were being held hostage on the moon, and he knew he had to act fast. He decided to go to the moon himself, rescue his friends, and stop Mr. Everhart's evil plan. As he arrived on the moon, he received new equipment, state-of-the-art technology that would aid him in his mission. But little did he know, Mr. Everhart had a mega robot waiting for him, remotely controlled and ready to destroy him.

The battle was intense, but Roger was determined to save his friends. Just as he was about to be overpowered, he received a special belt that allowed him to pause time. With this newfound power, he was able to destroy the robots and the boss robot, freeing his friends and sending Mr. Everhart to prison. But as they returned to their own timeline, something strange happened - the time vortex reset everyone's minds, and they forgot that Roger existed.

Roger was given a new task: to save all of space-time and his friends from Mr. Everhart, who had escaped from prison. With his trusty tool kit, special belt, and guns, Roger set out to complete his mission. He fought bravely, and in the end, he forced Mr. Everhart to fix the timeline. As the timeline was restored, Roger's friends remembered him, and he was finally recognized as the hero he was. His brother, who had been pretending to be the hero, was exposed, and Roger was hailed as the true savior of the world. He was reunited with his friends, and he was given the credit he deserved for saving the world. With his mission complete, Roger was finally able to retire from his job as a time agent and live peacefully.
