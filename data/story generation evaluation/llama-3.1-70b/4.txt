Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a brave young boy named Rohan. He lived with his wise and kind grandfather, who was loved by everyone in the village. One day, while Rohan was out playing, his grandfather went to the market to buy some groceries. But when Rohan returned home, he found that his grandfather was nowhere to be found. He searched the entire village, but there was no sign of him. Just as Rohan was starting to worry, he received a mysterious call from a stranger who told him that he had found his grandfather's phone on the road and that he should come to the old, abandoned forest on the outskirts of the village immediately.

Rohan rushed to the forest, his heart racing with fear. As he entered the forest, he heard strange and scary voices, but he didn't let that stop him. He kept walking deeper into the forest until he came across a clearing, where he found his grandfather tied up to a tree. A wicked man, with a cruel grin on his face, was standing next to him, holding a gun. The man threatened to kill Rohan's grandfather if he didn't do what he said. Rohan was horrified, but he refused to give in to the man's demands.

The wicked man, enraged by Rohan's bravery, pointed his gun at him and started counting down from five. Rohan closed his eyes, waiting for the worst, but just as the man was about to pull the trigger, a loud bang was heard, and the man fell to the ground. Rohan opened his eyes to see that his grandfather had managed to free himself and had shot the wicked man with a hidden gun. Rohan was overjoyed to see his grandfather safe and sound.

Together, they untied each other and ran back to their village, frightened by the thought of other dangers that might be lurking in the forest. But their relief was short-lived, as the village elder approached them and told Rohan that he had a difficult task ahead of him. The forest had a dark history, with many dead bodies found there in the past, and the elder suspected that there might be more kidnappers or bodies hidden deep within the forest. Rohan was tasked with exploring the forest and finding out the truth, but he was warned that if he failed, it would be his fault.

Rohan, though scared, accepted the challenge. He knew that he had to be brave and face his fears to uncover the secrets of the forest. With a determined heart, he set out on his mission, ready to face whatever dangers lay ahead.
