Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a kind and hardworking girl named Jane. She had a best friend named Mary, and they did everything together. But one day, Jane's family fell on hard times, and she had to make a difficult decision to move to Australia for a good job to support them. Mary was heartbroken, and Jane was too, but she knew she had to do this for her family.

Jane's teacher had once told her that loneliness can be very depressing, and that family and friends are a part of you. Jane tried to focus on the positive, thinking that her good earnings would change her family's bad times. And it did. Seeing the improvement in her family's condition gave her a massive satisfaction. She was happy knowing she was doing something for her family.

However, things weren't all smooth sailing in Australia. Jane's colleague, Sia, was jealous of her success and always tried to bring her down. She made false accusations and blamed Jane for things she hadn't done. But Jane didn't let it get to her. One day, she even saved Sia from a big accident on the road. Sia was shocked and realized that Jane wasn't a bad person, but a good friend in disguise. From then on, they became good friends.

After a few months, Jane decided to visit her family, and she was overjoyed to see them happy and in good condition. But they missed her a lot and were lonely without her. So, Jane decided to move her family to Australia with her. She was thrilled to be reunited with them and knew that this would be the end of her loneliness. This time, she wouldn't be traveling alone; she would be with her family.

Jane worked hard to settle her family in Australia. She found a job for her father and brother and a good school for her little sister. It wasn't easy, but she did it. Her family settled well, and they never had financial issues again. Jane even helped Mary move to Australia and find a good job. Finally, Jane was surrounded by her family and friends, and she was never alone again. She lived happily ever after, grateful for the difficult journey that had brought her to this point.
